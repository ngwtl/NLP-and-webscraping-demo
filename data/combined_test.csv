0,Automatic dark mode went missing after a restart,hfenbw,2020-06-25 02:47:32,"This week, the system update to QPKS30.54-22-9 (Android 10) and it was fine up until today. In the afternoon, the phone spazzed out (Motorola One, bought in 2019) and would pass the first few seconds of startup. 
After a while trying to reset it, I was successful, but the battery was showing 0%. So I restarted it in Safe Mode once, still nothing. Restarted it again (by turning it off, then on), I think it automatically started in normal mode and the battery gauge was working again. 
In the night time, I noticed none of the apps entered dark mode automatically and the option went missing from the Developer Settings, I had to manually select the dark theme from the Screen Settings.

TL;DR: Automatic Dark Theme according to time went missing from Developer Mode

Any ideas on who to activate automatic dark mode for the whole system again?",1,1.0,0.0,notexthere,0.0,8,146,1

Every time I reset my S8, it say “this device has been associated with an enterprise in the past” and when I try to proceed, it wont let me go any further since I no longer work for that company.

Is there any hope? This company has its own internal legal firm and I dont really want to go to court over a phone.

I've just gone through a similar situation in UK, where my employer was trying to force us into installing apps that can be used to track your location 24/7.
90% of us refused to install such apps but have now been given ""work phones"" so we don't have to use our own personal devices.

I checked with a legal firm and was told an employer cannot force you to install any corporate programming on any personal device or can we be tracked only via a vehicle tracker or company provided mobile device, and only after the employer has gained express written permission from the employee.. If they use some kind of MDM software, the IT dept of your former company can issue a factory reset command, and also unenroll it from MDM. There's no real reason they can't just issue the factory reset command then unenroll. All company data would then be erased.

MAYBE flashing the entire ROM would clear the MDM enrollment? It's Samsung so you can flash official ROMs without tripping Knox or vvoiding warranties or anything. If you try, let us know the outcome!. I smell a small claims court suit.. I wouldn't be surprised if they won't unlock it because they don't know how. They're either vindictive or ignorant, both of which I think you'll unfortunately only be able to fix with small claims court. Probably going to have to talk to a lawyer.

Anyways, never, ever, ever install anything that gives people control over your personal device.

In the event you need work apps on your phone, use an app like Island to make a work profile that these kinds of apps can be installed on.. Might want to find a law clerk to write up a intent to file desist order or law suit. Often if they know they are in the wrong they cooperate.

Other than that you could wipe the cell back to new clean condition. Reset to factory settings.. I’m gonna try Odin to flash it. I feel like its a vindictive move since my absence was untimely. They RIF’d most of my coworkers, then gave me their workload.. Their lawyers will find a loophole I’m sure.. This employer required all personal devices entering the building to have it. Aside from leaving my phone in the car all day, I figured it couldn’t hurt. They are extremely vindictive, since I left in the middle of a project due to a better opportunity..

Why am I not seeing my phone on the list of quick charge 3 and 4 on qualcomm's quick charge list?",2,1.0,5.0,"Just because a SOC supports quick change 4.0 that doesn't mean the phone will support it as well, it is up to the manufacturer to implement it, and afaik most of them use their own proprietary solutions.

In your case, if you say that you didn't saw your s8+ on the Qualcomm's quick charge list that means that Samsung didn't implement it.. It won't. Because even if the chipset supports QC3 or higher, the chipset isn't the one dictating the charge speed. There's still separate charging circuits that need to support the new quick charging. There's more stuff dictating the charging speed than the charger and CPU. The battery itself needs to be rated to withstand the faster power draw without blowing up for example. 

So no, the S8 will not support QC3 or higher. Also, the S8 supported by the QC3 charger only means that QC3 is backwards compatible to QC2. Because if it wasn't, the phone would have been slow charging, and not using even QC2.. Ow so even if the hardware is capable of it it depends on the manufacturer? But whhhhhhhhhyyy 🥺😔

How about Power delivery charging can my phone support it at least on somewhat fast charging method?. So I can say it is future proof but not guaranteed?.

That said, MTP sucks balls.

To paraphrase Pulp Fiction - Forget that cable. That cable goes against the entire idea behind smart devices. Every one of my files transferred, all done with a sync tool. Try Resilio, SyncThing, LanDrive, FolderSync.

With FolderSync you can either set a schedule, have it watch a local folder for new files, or create a shortcut to start a sync job. Resilio and SyncThing will keep specified local/remote folders in sync, and can either sync one-way or two-way, and can be limited to specific wifi networks.. Are you using Windows?  And how is the phone connected?  Is it connected as a media device, or is it connected as a storage device?

Windows has some ""smart"" built-in functions for connected media devices, where it thinks it's a good idea to convert files that may have format support inconsistencies.  I have definitely seen this prompt for both video and image files in the past, files are converted during transfer.  Could have been what happened in your case.

That being said, have you transferred those files BACK to a computer (not sure how) and checked the file details?  Could be an issue with how the end system is processing/handling the files rather than the files having changed.. you better off usijng a usb c dongle so that you can hook up a usb stick or cardreader to your phone and copy it over that way and then put the card reader in the pc.. an example of the pcitures would be great to make sure, upload one from the phone and one from pc. What you're claiming makes no sense. Can you provide some examples of files before and after this move that show the corruption or lack of resolution that you're talking about?. maybe your cord is damaged?  Send it with something else by bluetooth, see if its distorted/. > Resilio  ... can be limited to specific wifi networks.

The app has the feature, but does not request location access, so therefore cannot obtain what wifi network you are on. 

SyncThing also can't write to SD cards.. SyncThing writes to SD just fine for me. It asks for permission when you launch?

I hadn't seen that issue with Resilio (I just set it to wifi only). Good to know.. Sync thing does ask for permission to read the storage on first launch, but when trying to set up sync folders, it says it only has read only access, and blames my OS version (I'm on Pie).

I've moved on to just using OneDrive and Autosync for OneDrive to sync my files. Amazingly, Autosync is able to write to my SD card just fine, so leads me to believe it's not my OS that's the problem, but the developer not implementing something correctly.",479.0,16,115,1

>Any good one you could recommend?

The one that was used to delete it.. I didn't use any program to delete it. I ""deleted"" it directly from the pre-installed files app.. The files app varies depending on the manufacturer. Look for a ""trash"" option.

If you intend to delete it to prevent recovery not for space, fill the internal storage with something until it's full. It's now replaced. Recovery on Android however is .... not quite .... like the one on a PC.

The implementation of TRIM (true deletion) depends on the manufacturer. If rooted you might be able to run it. This affects the speed of adding something to internal storage, not space.. Thanks. I don't plan on recovering the file anyway, so it's fine. However, it's for the sole purpose of space.

Edit: ...found the trash. I was sure I had checked everywhere.

DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis012derkor\_002.m4a  
DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis012derkor\_004.m4a  
DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis012derkor\_007.m4a

They are separated by chapter (the numbers in the middle) but there  is no real logic with the ordering (the final number of the file name).

Also, to obtain the full list of entries, I will need to take screen  shots of each page on my Android phone or on my iPad and then run this  through my OCR software.

What I am hoping is that there is a way of somehow accessing the text  of an app and I can then manipulate the data on Excel. As an example,  something that might read:

{{English:Dog}}blahblahblah{{German:Der Hund}}blahblah{{Audio:DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis010diemen\_001.m4a}}

As you can see from my use of ""blah blah"" for technical speak, this is way beyond my limited IT skills ;)

The only alternative is to then listen to every sound file in one  target language, compare against the english audio and then refer to the  audio file name although fortunately I should only need to do this one  as the file names are the same in every language.

For reference, I have paid for the books, have purchased a few  E-Books and have downloaded the app and this is solely for my own use.

That is partially correct, yes he is safe if he sticks with play store, but if he downloads an .apk from a shady source and has the misfortune to get a ""virus"" worst thing you could get is adware, no antivirus will detect it, because they don't really do anything besides telling you do delete junk files and what settings to use to get a better battery life.

The best advice would be to pay attention to which sites he allows to send notifications, and to use an ad blocking DNS such as dns.adguard.com.. Malwarebytes has removed some adware I got from a shady apk.  It kept opening random adverts.  It really just told me to take away it's administrator permissions but it guided me through that and helped me remove the app.  Others experiences might be different but Android malware does not try to hide itself and it's pretty obvious when you open random advertisements so I would only download it after you already have the virus to help you clean it up.",344.0,7,67,1

79,"Why, oh why, does Android's WiFi tethering go around the phone's VPN, even when you have ""Always on VPN"" and ""Block all non-VPN traffic"" in the VPN settings?",her7tw,2020-06-24 01:05:39,"I use a mainstream US VPN provider just for a tiny amount of anonymity on the web, and so my cell provider can't see every site I go to. I just feel like that's an invasion of privacy. I also figured that if I tethered another device to my phone, it would just look like normal traffic from my phone. I used to use it on my home internet, too, but I don't have that now since I'm traveling.

But today, quite by accident, I learned that the WiFi hotspot feature on my phone is ignoring my VPN connection! I ran a speed test on my tethered PC just to see what I get and was alarmed that it said ""AT&T Wireless"" as my provider instead of some random ISP name my VPN vendor uses. If I search ""my ip"" on both my phone and PC I get different results. 

Why is this possible? Why does tethering traffic go around the VPN? 

I've been tethering like this for months. Ever since I learned that I can get full speed if I tether a DD-WRT-equipped router to my phone instead of my other devices directly. If I tether my devices directly, I get capped at 128 kbps speeds. Presumably because Cricket can figure out that they are not requests from my phone. I knew about PdaNet for a long time, and that gives me full speed, too, but it's flaky, I would have to reconnect a lot, and only works for some devices. I tried using my router in split client-router mode for a reason I can't even remember and was really surprised that doing so gave all my devices full speed. So now I have my tablet, PC, and even my Roku tethered to my phone through my router. I figured since my phone used the always-on VPN with ""Block non-VPN traffic"", I was fine. :(

So, now I'm worried that my provider (which is actually Cricket which uses AT&T networks) is going to catch on that I've been tethering. They supposedly only allow it with ""compatible phones"", and with a 15 GB limit. (I think you can pay for more *a la carte*.) I used over 100 GB of tethering just last month. It's not unreasonable to use that much as a heavy phone internet user with streaming video, heavy reddit app usage, and miscellaneous downloads, so I figured my VPN gave me plausible deniability. Well, not any more.

(I can use OpenVPN from within the DD-WRT firmware to negate the issue going forward, but that doesn't really help now, since I'm sure they have logs.)

How fucked am I if they figure it out? Could they drop me without warning and make me lose the phone number I've had all my life?

98,What Have I missed (returning to android from apple),hel1ga,2020-06-23 19:19:37,"I was an avid android user back in 2012/2013 (Sony xperia). I loved the customization especially when I rooted my phone and under-clocked it when not in use to lower battery consumption. However my family were big on the cult of apple and I ended up getting a few iPhones along the way (accepted them because why say no to a free and good phone right? Also made things like sharing chargers much easier)

Well folks I’ve gotten a bit tired of apples proprietary crap and have gone out of my way to come back to android. What have I missed since I was gone? (Moving from iPhone 6s to a mid range android). I’m already liking the fast charge, the mega sized batteries etc but what else? I’ve also noticed a few major brands like htc vanishing. What can I look forward to back in the promised land of freedom as it were ;)?",39,0.9,31.0,"Root is pretty rare & generally considered unnecessary these days, I don't think ANYONE undervolts anymore, removable batteries are completely gone, headphone jacks and sd cards are disappearing too (at least at the high end), HTC is dead outside of Taiwan, Sony is nowhere to be seen Stateside, OnePlus came along to mix things up and is kind of HTCs ""spiritual successor"" IMO, but  innovation has stagnated for the most part.

It's a pretty boring time TBH, but welcome back all the same :). Some random personal notes:

Samsung, who was the opposite of Apple back in the days, is now the same as Apple, just with Android os. Huawei is even worse.

Locked bootloaders became the norm. But also officially unlockable bootloaders became the norm for some brands. When buying a phone make sure it's unlockable. Google has moved a lot of stuff from aosp to their proprietary services. Banking (and some other areas) are hard to do on an unlocked phone. Contrary to what other users say: people still root their phones and mod the hell out of it, just google Magisk. But I'd say back in the day customizing android was almost necessary, while today it's more of a hobby for many people.

There is a new type of universal roms, calles gsi roms. Those can be installed on any (newish) android phone with unlockable bootloader, no device specific rom needed any more. Those are quite new and standard roms are still mostly used though.. For me I think Android is still ahead as far as capability. I have an iPhone as well as my note 10+ but I like the note more, partly for the reasons op mentioned. 

As far as things you've missed op, Android has gotten a lot better at power management. Battery life is much better, Android is more stable. I haven't seen an Android app crash in years. App quality has also improved, though not to the levels of the iPhone.. It's not the land that was promised, for sure, but it's prob better than the competition, at least as far as basic productivity tools, proper multitaskng, ability to root and still keep up to date, price, etc.  The usual stuff.  It def mostly lacks the professional quality apps of the App store, but if you are mostly emailing, web browsing, and making phone calls, and want to do them all together without the os closing apps all the time (mostly to cover for crap battery life), then android is the only game in town!. Samsung One UI is way better than Touchwiz, HTC, Sony and Motorola almost disappeared, Androir stock is very good. Well if you liked rooting your phone and your carrier is GSM, get a Xiaomi phone, they are really cheap and the rooting/custom rom scene is reeeeally big. The batteries are amazing and the price is too

For a mid range android i'd reccomend a Xiaomi Mi 9T, i think that's a great reccomendation to show off Android, although the stock rom might have some ads (hence why the price is low), but there are dozens or hundreds of roms to choose for, a lot of modded apps like Google Camera (from pixels) or Magisk modules (root but systemless, apps won't see that you're rooted)

I don't think you missed much, lately google is just polishing the system, but you definely missed the bad android phones that lagged on every step. Everything Android could do 10 years ago is what iOS can do now or will do when iOS 14 is rolled out (as long as you do it the way Apple tells you to via their UX/UI design).

The best way I can describe the only difference between them now is this: using iOS is like never leaving your hometown. Using Android is like traveling the world.. Dead Cells on Android.. "" but innovation has stagnated for the most part."" tends to happen with mature technologies, same thing happened with PC's, 15 years between 1980s to 1995 PC's were constantly seeing new innovations and new ways to advance the hardware, consequently lots of proprietary. Then the technology began to mature, the last major innovations that happened really being dedicated Vram and later on mutli core processors, everything then on forwards was either an improvement on existing tech or its integration into basic hardware (like sound-cards now being in both headphones and motherboards by default). Also happened with cars, stagnation is synonymous with maturity in tech.. Boring maybe but stability and usability have never been better. You can get cheaper phones that are more than sufficient or go high end and not need half the features. 

Android has matured a lot over past few years. > but innovation has stagnated for the most part.

Just upgraded from a 3 year old LG V30 to a Samsung S20, and this is the first time I've ever gotten a new phone and not been blown away by how much better it is than the old one. 

Aside from a slight camera improvement and the 120 Hz screen, there is nothing to get excited about. Was totally expecting more for a $900 phone.. >Root is pretty rare & generally considered unnecessary these days 

Really? Whys that, I heard Smart phone manufacturers still lock boot loaders and other useful  functions still. 

>I don't think ANYONE undervolts anymore

Well with giant batteries and massive improvements to consumption thats no surprise, under-clocking my phone back in the day was so good because it was consuming a decent amount of power even in standby

>Headphone jacks and SD cards are disappearing too

Partially due to the rising expectation and demand for IP67+ specs on phones, (having said spec on a phone with open ports is a serious engineering challenge indeed ). Combined with the fact that consumers indicated that they are willing to let the jack go, theres been little resistance on the jack going away on the consumer side. The SD cards disappearing is down to many Smartphone manufacturers planning on trying to get folks to buy cloud storage instead (also, again apple showed consumers will tolerate this lack of upgrade-ability and will buy icloud storage). 

I come back  as an IT expert as well, I do plan to make a few utility apps here and there.. Damn I'm really out of the loop. I've never heard about gsi roms till today, was even looking to buy a new phone just because there wasn't any custom roms for mine.. The apps switching off on the iphone did get really f***ing annoying after a while, especially if I used 2fa on an app only for it to reset on reloading the app.. >Well if you liked rooting your phone and your carrier is GSM

The phone is unlocked and im a european, GSM isnt a thing here aside from being an online retailer (at least in ireland).. Dead cells? Like battery? Pixels?. Yea that's a fair point.. >"" but innovation has stagnated for the most part."" tends to happen with mature technologies

They said this about mobile phones in general and then along comes a iPhone.. I'm a little confused, I was explaining it like you were not in the loop, but you seem to already know your shit friend haha. Why even ask the question?. >  Whys that?

Well its not really necessary any more. The old reasons for rooting aren't really needed.

- Bloatware is far less of an issue (not entirely but better)

- Internal Storage is greater so you dont need to worry about saving every last byte. Useless apps can usually easily be disabled without the need to delete them entirely.

- Smoothness is no longer a massive issues, even for budget phones - so no need to tweak kernels or anything like that to get it to not stutter.

- Rooting can disable improtant features like contactless payment.

- Adblocking can be achieved without root - just change your dns settings and thats it.

- ROMs - far less popular and necessary. They were a necessary evil back in the day - now they are strictly for hobbyists.. GSM is an antenna standard. The whole world uses is besides the United states which uses their own standard alongside gsm. I’m pretty sure he meant the game: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.deadcells.mobile. smart phones are basically a different technological category and were described as such, the first iphone for example in Job's own words is a scaled down mac, traditional phones havent changed from then aside from being less expensive basically.. I have some knowledge on hardware trends due to my background in IT (computer science specializing in cyber security) , however on android specific matters (like the OS), and what not, especially when you mention the near extinction of rooting (a big thing when I was using android), I am out of the loop, why rooting ded lol?. They looked pretty neat.. im much much more excited for eve echoes, the eve online port to mobile (its still a genuine eve experience with all the risk and politics and complexity the game has),. Yes cars have just 4 wheels there has not been any innovation since the 1920's. You sound like a really dumb guy.. It's not dead. Tons of people still root, check out r/AndroidRoot to get a better picture.

It's just not as widespread and popular as it used to be back in the ""golden era"", mainly its because:

a) Android and the hardware it runs on is now ""good enough"" for most people - no need to OC or change skins or debloat (on a decent device). There are stock Android devices like the Google Pixel, OnePlus or Android One devices, which work really well out of the box and there's little reason to warrant messing with them. Even Samsung devices have come along a long way with their new OneUI skin that replaced the old laggy and bloated TouchWiz skin, and it looks pretty decent too.

b) it's becoming increasingly a PITA to keep up with all the changes Google is doing (eg the A/B partition system) the security measures they keep implementing (SafteyNet). Rooting may be viable now but not tomorrow. Not everyone has the enthusiasm or patience to keep up with all this.

c) on many devices, rooting comes with disadvantages like not being able to view Netflix in full HD or playing the cat-and-mouse game with banking apps, games and some social media apps that detect root. On Samsung devices, merely unlocking the bootloader permanently blows the eFuse which permanently voids warranty and also permanently removes certain features like Secure Folder and Private Browsing, which reduces the resale value of the device.

d) OTAs can also be a pain depending on the device you're using. On some devices, OTAs may not work at all. On some devices, you may need to unroot before you accept an OTA. On all devices, you'll need to manually restore root after an OTA.

So as a result, we don't generally recommend anyone to root, unless they have a *really* good use case and are prepared to accept all the headaches that come with it.

Personally, as a geek and security/privacy conscious person, I always root and ROM all my Android devices and will continue doing so for the foreseeable future.. move along troll, the adults are talking. >the security measures they keep implementing (**SkyNet**).

What!? Oh, no!

Oh! Oh. Sorry. Carry on.. You got me there for a sec. My WiFi is called ""SkyNet"" and I saw your  notification pop up and read it as ""SkyNet security measures...""and I was like.. Uh what?!

Whereas flagship phone nowadays, they all look same.  I personally think smartphone industry need a big change in phone design department.

Does anyone agrees with me? Also, do you miss the designs of old smart phones??",7,0.89,6.0,"Yes, I very like Samsung S5 backplate, it's covered by rubber that looks like it's leather.. I had two Nexus 5s in the course of it's life, and I thought it was amazing. The design was nice, it was used as a staple for a lot of customisations including customs ROMs and stuff, just had a few issues such as the power button breaking (to the point where mine actually ripped off the motherboard). My first N5 updated once and never turned back on (completely stock too). Overall I miss that phone and agree that the phone industry needs spicing up, not with a new notch or something either.. I agree. I am against no or less button trend also. It could increase parts of the phones life span but it makes the phone less useful. And also I think phones need some directional buttons, like d-pads on game controllers. It could make easier to scroll. If you have a bigger device scrolling or reaching some areas extremely hard with one hand.. Well some things are just... evolution?

Like the front of a phone: We want screens as big as possible on devices as small as possible. That just leads to phones where the entire front is the screen. Just like that we have a universal design for the front, leaving just the sides and the back for design decisions. The sides are just the sides. With the backside manufacturers are actually getting increasingly creative, with crazy materials reflecting light in multiple colors etc. The backsides used to be a lot more boring back in the days!

Imo a modernized m7 would be the ultimate design: Make it almost bezelless on the sides, but leave a small bezel on the top and bottom. Integrate those kick ass stereo speakers there, plus front camera, sensor etc. pp. We can spare those 2mm. The trade offs for going full bezelless (mechanical camera or teardrop cutouts, sensors below screen, speakers...) are not worth it currently. Once under the screen front cameras become the norm that's another story though.. My micormax came in turquoise and boi was that sexy af. I agree, the triple camera is more like tricophobia lol..

Now on iOS 14 Apple is adding widgets, biking to Maps, App Gallery, and all this other stuff that Androids has before 6 years ago. It just blows my mind how late in the game. (The only reason I have an iPhone know is I prefer smaller screens, I need to jailbreak, I feel so limited).",0,0.25,7.0,"First of all, you're comparing one company to a platform that has probably hundreds of brands. 

and people should care who does it better, not who does it first. And it's not like it doesn't happen the other way.. Apple never really is first with anything. They just take proven technology and refine it a bit better.. There were electric cars before Teslas, too. But AFAIK, only one company develops Android.

Also, I don’t understand how the new SE can’t have face unlock and tap to wake? I know it’s possible through jailbreak, but Apple doesn’t make it easy to keep custom modifications.. > But AFAIK, only one company develops Android.

But many features don't come from Android itself.. many features are added in by the OEMs.

Not to mention face unlock on iPhones is way more advanced and secure compared to what you had on your LG. The SE isn't a new phone really, essentially it's an iPhone 8 with a new processor which is what helps keep it cheap. Face unlock on iPhone uses special sensors which make it very secure whereas most, if not all, android face unlock implementations just use the front camera which isn't anywhere near as secure or reliable. 

Security is important to apple so they wouldn't go that route. Adding their face unlock technology to the SE would likely increase the price a good bit and probably require a redesign which is unnecessary when touch ID is secure and works pretty well. 

I don't see the benefit of tap to wake when there's literally a button on the screen which will wake it if you tap it.. I’m sure that’s true, but all the features I talked about were added in subsequent Android updates.",288.0,17,84,1

But still, she usually has a better signal than I do.

I have been comparing our phones and as I can see, mine is better on all parameters.

What could be the cause?",2,1.0,6.0,"Yours isnt better in alot of areas,but the s8 has a better modem.. Compare DL Frequency or EARFCN in \*\#0011\#. If different, then the phone is measuring a different signal. A different signal has a different signal strength (dBm). The signal that's selected depends on measurement results, a priority system, and what the phone supports.

If referring to the speed:

Secondary frequencies that were ACT or ACTIVATED by the network are listed in \*\#0011\#. These contribute to the speed. While connected to a primary, the network will start the add/config/added state depending on the secondaries the phone supports. It may later start the activated state until an inactivity timer expires.

In the Exynos variant, the use of an extension (when the signal is great) that adds extra but subtle signal changes is displayed in \*\#0011\# as DL MCS:8 for downloads and UL MCS:6 for uploads. This exists in the S8 and may be enabled. Not displayed in the Snapdragon variant.

In the Exynos variant, 4 antennas receiving separate data (up to 4x faster, or 2x faster compared to the normal setup) is shown in \*\#0011\# as MIMO Mode/MIMO RI: TBD / 4 ... 3 or 4. The phone looking at any other kind of signal from 4 of its antennas is not displayed, only 4 tower antennas sending separate data and the phone receiving separate data from 4 antennas. This exists on the S8 and may be enabled. Not displayed in the Snapdragon variant.. Is that why it has a better signal?. When typing #0011# is say ""Connection problem or invalid MMi-number"" (translated from Danish). Yes, most likely.. 0011 is enabled in 100% of S8 consumer software customizations but starting it could be prevented by other means (like on the S8 Verizon variant); or not enabled because an update was incomplete. The earfcn is given to third party apps that show the signal and no other content.

In the S8 Verizon variant, decoding of Band 1 signal is not supported. If this is indeed that variant, the signal strength might be lower in the a80 due to band 1 being selected as high priority, it is after all not only signal strength that matters. The bars are also designed differently.

It should be enabled on the a80 International quite like the a50.",376.0,5,56,1

So too occasionally Google can patch issues through Google Play Services (not Play Store under 10) but that's not too likely either. 

9 should be supported until next year for security updates as well (7.x ended last year, 8.x likely this). Annoying how OEMs abandon devices ain't it?.

>Since you are rooted, you can try following this guide on XDA: How to Reduce the Long Press Delay Beyond its Lowest Setting. You can run the command in a terminal emulator like Termux like this for a 0.4 seconds delay: su -c ""settings put secure long_press_timeout 400""

>I applied the setting with a timeout of 250, pop up menu feels super responsive (fast). 

I have a Note 8 (N950F), rooted and custom recovery. Android 8.0.0

I read a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/h9x99k/if_you_were_having_trouble_copying_and_pasting/) about customizing the ""Touch and hold delay"" which affects the time it takes the phone to pop up a shortcut menu ( like the copy - paste ..etc. when you select a text, press and hold).

In a nutshell, the settings menu does not allow customizing that delay below 0.5 seconds, need to find accessibility settings storage location in the file system, I tried searching by package name for settings app in /data/data .. found nothing.

**More details:**

I found the ""Touch and hold delay"" under settings > Accessibility > Dexterity and interaction

it has 4 options  
Short (0.5 seconds)  
Medium (1.0 seconds)  
Long (1.5 seconds)  
Custom

When I select custom, it presents a screen where I have to touch and hold a circle for the custom desired time. The problem is any touch and hold time less that 0.5 seconds does not allow saving, only when you touch and hold longer than 0.5 seconds it lights up the save button!

Is there anything about it you do like?


1. Android 10 has gesture navigation by default, so you must have knew it was there when you brought the device.
If you say yoy didn't know about gesture navigation I don't believe you.
You should have a setting in display to turn three button navigation back on (Nokia's, Samsung and most other android 10 devices do)

2. Have a look on XDA in your device threads.

3. Without TWRP number 4 isn't possible.

Not being mean to you, but I had a device with those ""niggling"" issues I would not keep it, I would change it.

I do find it difficult to accept you brought this device and didn't know what the device had when you purchased it, so why now complain?

Please explain, I'm just curious what annoys you so much, Motorola are great devices.. 1) Never knew about changing back to 3 button from gesture. Bought off Ebay. Phone only. No nothing.

2) XDA does not have a great following on the One Hyper. Seems to be the ""bastard"" of the Motorola line on XDA

3) Can boot animations be pushed via adb or fastbootd?

Just a few things I like to be a certain way.

179,Onepus 6T or Samsung Galaxy s9?,hdr6fy,2020-06-22 12:08:05,"Hello guys, i’m going to buy a used android phone. And i have 2 options. Samsung Galaxy s9 and oneplus 6T. Which one should i chooese and why (both are €180 and the s9 is exynos)",2,1.0,4.0,"It really depends what you are looking for. Both phones are close to their last updates.

The S9 is running OneUi from Samsung and it's quite bloated with all the Samsung extra apps. You can root it and do some changes on it but there's pros and cons to that.

The 6T is very similar to the OP7. Almost identical to the naked eye (I have the OnePlus 7). It has better specs and performance than the S9. It is a faster phone and it will, in my opinion, last you longer. OnePlus phones tend to age well. If you are going for very close to stock feeling, this phone does that and it does it very smooth as well. Almost 0 bloat too. It is very customizable even without rooting it.

However, if camera is a big point for you, I suggest you have a look at some reviews for both phones on that aspect. S9 will probably be a better camera phone. There is GCam for OnePlus, but it's not perfect and it requires some manual customization.

If you don't care much for the camera, go for 6T. If camera is very important to you, do some research of the 2 based on camera.. Well the camera is somewhat important because i sell phones/Computers online. But honestly i will go with the OP6T then.. Op6T does not have a bad camera per se. It's just not a top notch camera. If you install GCam with the right configuration you will have better results.. Ok thanks!",253.0,6,36,1

Info:

The problem stated yesterday on my Galaxy Note 8. Not sure if related but a TMobile update came in overnight. I also drop my phone a lot but it is in an otterbox defender. No physical defects are visible and everything else about my phone is fine. This is a new problem I've never had before. Ask me anything else you need to know!

https://imgur.com/YRteSog",32,1.0,12.0,"You said you drop your phone a lot, maybe one of the drops loosened the connection of the fingerprint with the motherboard. Even if your phone was in a case, although it doesn't suffer any cosmetic damage, it still can get internally damaged or get loosened connections. 

One thing you can try is a factory reset if that doesn't fixes it, I don't know what to tell you.. About the otterbox defender case bro.. Careful! I had note 8 for 3years and twice my screen cracked on the same spot by where the pen is, both times it did a little half moon looking crack then a while back sprint did this deal where they fixed galaxy phone screens for 50 bucks got it fixed and sold it to a buddy with the case and i noticed his screen has that same crack on that corner man, the design isnt quite right on that defender case some places charge around $300 to fix the screen on those phones!. It's hard to say if it's the update or the dropping. That's bad timing. 

I would not try to open it. You will need something with directed heat like a hot air reflow station to loosen the adhesive, carefully cut the outer most rim of it while not breaking the back. 

This is one of those cases where a factory reset wouldn't be a bad idea. 

Have you tried ""(star)#0(star)#"" and gone to sensors and checked the finger print test there?

Stupid Reddit formatting removing the asterisk. Where do I find this theme?. This is a very good possibility. Friend of mine dropped her phone, no visible damage so she had a sigh of relief but realized it wouldn't turn on. Cracked it open, motherboard broke in half. I used to dissect my iPhones back in the day. Would this be a difficult to work on?. I paid like $100 to get it replaced a few months ago. I'm not a fan of the new defender cases.. https://imgur.com/4KtLlGC. Yes, very, the phone is water resistant, so it is glued shut, you would need to heat it up evenly and need some prying tools, and even if you manage to pry it open without cracking the glass back, water resistance would be compromised.. I have a note10+ and did put a defender case on it but the only reason i did is because this otterbox model has the rubber on the inside and hard case on the outside note 8 one is weirdly the opposite the phone makes contact with the hard plastic with soft rubber outside.. Thanks. Sounds like a visit to the guys who put the glass on for me is in order. That's disappointing. Thanks, stranger.",455.0,3,111,1

He answered me that Odin isn't Samsung's tool and it is Open-source, so that the service centres use another utility software. Moreover he also explained me that downgrade or more in general flashing isn't allowed by Samsung . So even if I flash the stock rom (and KNOX is still 0x0000), will I void Samsung warranty?

TL;DR: does it work? How?

But I'd love to be able to turn off notifications for all work related apps on weekends or during vacation.

I'll gladly delete in that case and go to where the right subreddit may be. I've become desperate and I don't know how to fix this. I'm not phone savvy so please bear with me. 

I have a Samsung Galaxy A10e and I've had it since January. No spills or hard falls, yet it has somehow stopped charging normally. I've tried cleaning the charger point out along with the charger itself to no avail. The issue started sometime after the most recent update though I didn't think much of it as I know it's rarely software updates that cause these things. It was usually fixable, but now it is not. It doesn't seem like my charger port is bent (gap is there) and I'm not sure what the issue is. 

For reference, it says that it is always charging even when it isn't plugged in. It is not the charger that it came with and I don't know what happened to that one (I've moved since January) either, but it's always been compatible until recently. Now it won't charge at all and it always acts like it's plugged in when it isn't. I've tried using Google to do some tech support, but it's been hours to no avail.

I have a bluetooth FM transmitter in my car for listening to music through my phone on a car that is a little older and bluetooth earbuds.

I walk my dog a lot. I turn on bluetooth. I go outside. It connects to my car.  I swap to my earbuds. It decides I actually made a mistake and kindly reconnects to my car. I, again, choose my earbuds.

I start the walk. I make it back to my street. About 2 houses away, it once again decides that I actually want to use bluetooth in my car and automatically swaps to my car. I swap back. I walk into my kitchen, still listening to music.

""Hey, I noticed you were within one hundred meters of your car. Let me go ahead and swap to your car."" says bluetooth.

I finally give up and turn my music off.

Next day:

I get into my car. I turn bluetooth on. It TURNS MY EARBUDS ON from being shut off and connects to them instead of my car.  I manually swap back. This happens again during my drive.

I'm sitting at work. I want to make a phone call. It turns my earbuds on and decides to use those. I ultimately shut bluetooth off.

I go into settings. Silly me, obviously theres a way to turn off bluetooth automatic connecting feature on a 2020 smart phone, right?

Any way to force the phone input through the internal microphone?
My device is Samsung Galaxy M30
Android version is 10",3,0.81,10.0,"Just out of the top of my head:

Place tape on your headset jack to cover just the mic pin (usually the one at the tip). Be careful to use very sticky tape, or it might end up jammed into the socket.

You could also go for mic-less headphones.

Edit: I had it wrong, it's the third one from the tip that has the microphone signal. That's not gonna do jack about telling the software which microphone to use.. Android behaves in a way that if no headphone mic is detected, it will use the internal mic.

Details about the behaviour of 3 pin audio jack's with android phones can be found here: https://www.quora.com/Can-I-use-my-mobiles-built-in-microphone-to-attend-calls-via-headphones?share=1

Also, there was a bug in Lollipop which would prevent using the internal mic but it has been resolved 5 years ago by Google (if you were referring to that): https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus5/comments/35f9h8/headphones_without_mic_any_way_to_use_them_for/

I literally just tested headphones with no mic to make a call and it used the internal mic just as I described.

For these reasons, I believe your reply was just a guess, and that you didn't check before downvoting me. Please don't do that :(

Edit: your comment reads as a joke too, perhaps it wasn't you who downvoted me, but my statement is still valid for the ones who did downvote me. Putting tape over the microphone isn't going to make Android think it's not there though.. Just for reference: it does. I have no idea where you get your info from.... It's still gonna try to take in audio through the mic hole, but it'll just be muffled because you covered it with tape. It's not gonna realize the audio is muffled and switch to a different mic input. You'd have to do something with software, or mess with Bluetooth codecs for wireless buds. I imagine that would be awfully uncomfortable anyway to have tape on your earbuds, unless the mic is father down the wire on a wired pair.. What the hell?! If the pin is covered in tape, there will be no contact whatsoever, no signal, not the slightest hint of a mic enabled headset connected.

I'm done with you, do your research, provide me with links or any kind of reference...

And I don't mean to be rude, it's nothing personal against you, I just dislike the fact that you're guessing away things with no reference. Also English is not my native language and I have no idea how I sound.. The pin? What the hell are you talking about?. Oh, I think I understand why we don't understand each other. I'm not talking about the microphone that is located somewhere on the right earphone cable, I'm talking about the metal part that you put inside your phone. The jack. The metal pin that is at the very end of the cable.

Did you check the Quora link that I provided? There is a diagram of the connector viewed from the side, and markings describing what section of the connector carries which signal. That's what I've been talking about the whole time!. Holy shit lmao

200,Unable to change system language to Korean.,hdj1ro,2020-06-22 01:52:53,"I'm a person who is learning the Korean language as a hobby, and to help myself learn it, I've decided to try and change my phone language to Korean, but the problem is, my phone only has English and Spanish.

**I have an LG Rebel 4 LTE phone running Android 8.1 (Oreo).** My problem is simple, but confusing, I already knew how to access the language and input settings to change a language, but like I said, it only told me I had English and Spanish to choose from. I decided to look for tutorials online, maybe thinking that I was somehow going to the wrong place, but even tutorials using the same exact version of android that I have had access to all kinds of languages.  
I also use the google keyboard, which does allow for Korean input, but that's different from my base android settings.

One thing I find interesting (which you can see in the screenshot I provide) is that the Spanish setting says ""United States"", making me believe that maybe just because I'm in the United States, that I can only choose languages from the United States? That doesn't make sense to me considering people from other countries move here all the time and would like to use things in their native language.  
Is there any way to add the Korean language to my phone?

You don't want to have it not happen because if it is what I think it is, if it didn't happen your phone would have been bricked and you MIGHT have been able to get it restored at a repair place that is set up for that.

It also could be a hardware issue that is falsely detecting corruption, or part of your ROM storage may have gone bad.  In those cases and given the age of your device it is long past due time to upgrade to a new device.  Most Android and iPhone devices are made to have a 3 to 4 year life cycle, and most android support is gone after 2 years so by now your device is also becoming a security risk.

I recently bought a ""Bring Your Own Device"" SIM card trying to bring a Samsung Galaxy A50 from Verizon to Straight Talk.  I got the SIM card and followed the instructions to get my device activated, but couldn't make calls, text, use mobile data, etc.  I looked on my account on the Straight Talk website and my service is active with the correct phone number there.  I got a hold of Straight Talk customer service and they wanted me to add an APN at the Access Point Names setting on my phone.  Once I got there, it said ""Access point names are not available for this user"" and I am unable to add an APN or reset the APN settings.  They said I need to go to a Samsung manufacturer to get my phone reset and then the APN setting should work.  I am not sure what exactly they meant by that.  So, after doing some researching and not getting any solutions that worked for me, I am hoping someone here could help me with this problem in being able to add an APN.

It seems like when the phone is \*attempting\* to connect to mobile data it locks the APN settings so you can't play with them. If they're not correct for some reason then it doesn't connect and isn't bright enough to stop trying or give a useful error message. Most people that have fixed it have done so basically by chance after multiple reboots, usually connecting to WiFi straight away helps. 

Makes me wonder if turning airplane mode on would help, maybe a reboot while it's on if the phone remembers that airplane mode is on after a reboot.  
It was also a big issue with the Asus Zenphone, the final fix for that particular phone was a firmware/rom update from Asus.. Thank you for your reply and the APN settings.  When I switch to airplane mode, the phone greys out the setting that APNs are under and I can't get to it.  I have tried rebooting my phone with WiFi on, but that hasn't worked yet.

RELEVANT INFORMATION:

Had this issue for many years across many Android phones: Galaxy S6 Edge+, Note 7, Pixel 2 XL, Note 9, and Note 10. Doubt it's a Samsung-specific issue because of that Pixel.

Each of the aforementioned phones ran a different version of the OS and were always updated as updates were made available. None of my phones were rooted at any point.

The device I try texting to doesn't seem to make a difference either, be it another Android phone or an iPhone, with a couple exceptions: texting from a Samsung phone with Samsung's messaging app set as the default to another Samsung phone with Samsung's messaging app set as the default never gave me problems; and I haven't had problems texting any Android phone since Google rolled out Chat features as long as both of us are using Google's messaging app as the default.

I don't always know which carrier the receiving device is on, but I can confirm the issue exists when texting AT&T or T-mobile customers. It's safe to assume Verizon or any other carrier would behave similarly.

The issue also occurs whether the recipient's device or my device are connected via Wi-Fi, LTE, or 3G.

My mobile carrier is the only constant. I've had the same T-Mobile USA account for the duration of my time with Android phones. In case it makes any difference, I switched T-Mobile rate plans once about two years ago.

Of course I know this would be incredibly hard to find in this age of phones, but this is my dream phone.. An iphone. Optimazation>specs. Y'all brainwashed, specs isnt everything. Apple shows that clearly. Optimization>specs. 12/16 gigs of ram?. Again.. y'all brainwashed.. optimization is the key of a perfect phone. The S5e tablet has it as well.. S10e has it, sony phones had it years ago. I'm still on LG G6, has finger scanner in power button. ""would rather have forehead"" - then just turn on the black bar pretty much every phone has a notch or hole has. Then at least you can put the clock and icons up there freeing up more of the part of the screen you actually use. Otherwise with a forehead you end up with the exact same thing except the status bar is pushed under the camera and takes away useable space.. Check out Samsung M30s. Apple literally does the opposite, their processors are the best in the market, it's not just optimization, specially because they usually don't put enough ram on their phones and stuff like the 4s happens. What...? Android can optimize and also customize anything while apple is extremely limited.... Optimize at the cost of specs = No features, ugly and hard to change UI, ram so low you can barely have more than 2 apps open pretty average screens with massive vessels and notch, etc.. Meaning 12 or 16. Obviously you're the one brainwashed letting others tell you what you do and don't need. Reread the title numbnuts. It's dream phone. There is no wrong answer. Narrow and short-sighted views like yours hinder innovation. 

I imagine you to be the kind of person back in the day fighting saying we don't need the lightbulb, we just need a better candle.. What is this tablet?. The power button is in the back right? I remember lg doing this stuff. 4s is 10 years old... Why would you customize? And Android can't optimize well because of a variety of specs.. Also you can have the most ram. But also many bg apps eating from it. The best camera. But a camera app that ruins it. Best display. But eating your whole battery.. Also what is something sooo task heavy that you need a high end phone for... That's a iPhone.. I am talking about their hardware. Not software. No I get what you mean, I'm just saying why on earth do you need 16 gigs of ram?. Makes no sense what you said as last. Samsung Galaxy S5e. Yes, exactly.. I'm just using as an example? That phone in ios 9 is just useless. Because every person is different? It's like saying why have colour options on a phone... And what is this ""variety of specs"". I barely have any background apps eating my ram. I just have to be smart about what I install. The camera app that my Samsung has, does not even compare closely to the iOS app. iOS has no pro mode, hyper lapse and 30 sec shutter options in the native app for example. And as for the display, it probably saves more battery even while being bigger than the one I had on my old iPhone.. Appart from the A13 chip, iOS has wayyy worse hardware than most phones.. Why do people need a 55"" (Guilty) TV in a living room? I can't justify it, a 40-something probably would have been fine but why not go for a 55""? I might be able to use it somewhere else later, it's nice to have, etc

Future proofing and heavy multitasking and opening new options not originally intended. Say someone figures out how to port or dual boot a full fledged OS.

There are more possibilities to exploit (in a positive way) the hardware to do more.. 1. You just literally have 2 web browser 2 cameras and 2 email apps that can't be uninstalled
2. I am talking about the quality. Yes IOS may have less feautures but makes good pictures
3. iPhones has smaller battery. Thats the problem... Hardware optimazation*. Nevermind.... Didn't mean anything by it.  It's just that you will never need 16 gigs in your lifetime.  Cheers. That's straight up false. I only have 1 mail and 1 browser because I deleted the Samsung equivalents. No camera beats the s20 ultra. Simple as that. And as for the screen/battery problem, Samsung makes iPhone screens which is why they are wayyy more optimiser for Samsung phones. Check your facts dude.. I didn't take it the wrong way, I'm just saying it leaves room to do things you didn't know you wanted to do or could do. 

Not too long ago it was unfathomable that we would need GBs of RAM or GBs of HDD storage but look at us today.. Yup like I said I get it",2111.0,5,69,1

I just ran the unlock code for my new G Power, once I got past the login page it worked fine. Hopefully the warranty isn't voided unless the code is actually used, I'm still waiting for something better than Android 10 to be available before I'll take the risk of unlocking it..

It'd help if you and others could help test but I'm very certain Motorola's website is broke, and can't send verification emails. I've had one other person come on and say he's also having the issue. Yes this is correct, you somehow need that code, as device info is not viewable you are probably still locked. You mean the ""Unlocking your Device"" subject line email from [""donotreply@motorola.com](mailto:""donotreply@motorola.com)"" that I received with my bootloader unlock code during my test for my previous reply?

Your ID has to be verified and working on Moto's site before it will work on the unlock page. Try to sign in from their main page or their [support page](https://support.motorola.com/us/en/). It's possible they've put your email domain on a spam blacklist, I've had that happen with my Yahoo email at a few places (they blacklisted Yahoo in general while others blacklisted Gmail in general....the working one I used with Moto was my gmail).. Yeah so thats where my issue is. I have no problem trying to get that code, but when i try to get it, i run into the error i mentioned in my post. Idk if its just me unable to access anything past the page, but it really seems like an issue with the website stopping me... Ok so sorry for the double comment but I did misunderstand the issue. The home page of Motorola is fine, it is this page specifically that has the issue https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-a

When I click next and sign in it'll give me an error and say I can't. I would appreciate it if you tried if you can/have a Motorola account already, it's cool if you don't want to, I'm just trying to pin point the problem myself and I think it's here.

I have an account made on https://motorola.com and signed in.. I can login there perfectly fine, no issues, with both a yahoo account I apparently made some time ago and a gmail account I made because I didn't remember the first when I bought my G Power 2 in April.  
I tried making yet another account a couple hours ago with a yahoo email address, they still haven't actually sent the verification code so something is messed up with their system.. Ok, thank you. I actually am getting verification emails from the main page now, for me I believe it is either just that page to access the bootloader codes or it's Motorolas servers in general being fucky. Either way ig I'm fucked till they fix it. Appreciate the help though",960.0,8,128,1

Has my device already been compromised or does the security app hold it momentarily until I decide to delete it via the security app or keep the apk.

What exactly is the process and what is the security app doing? How is it protecting my device? Are there any checks I can do to further strengthen my security?",15,0.81,31.0,"Security apps are useless. The only people who ever get malware on their phones are the unaware and careless ones. Just watch what you download and where you get it from and your phone will be fine.

But to answer your question, if an app is deleted quick enough, you can catch it before it enables itself.. APK's (app files) are basically ZIP files with an odd extension. The security app opens it up, scans the contents and if it finds something crazy it tells you about it.  
If the APK hasn't been run then it hasn't done anything to the phone.. > Are there any checks I can do to further strengthen my security?

Yes, stop assuming an antivirus is a free pass to download random apps from the internet.. If you just downloaded the APK, but never installed it, nothing has happened. Also anti-malware apps on Android really are unnecessary and much less effective than PC anti-malware programs. If you're installing an APK from the internet than scan it using the VirusTotal website, if nothing comes up positive than an anti-malware app wouldn't detect anything either, and just make sure to only download from APKMirror or F-Droid or a source you 100% know is legitimate. Also some apps on the Play Store are malware, however anti-malware apps will never detect that.. May I ask what the use of the app was supposed to be?. Did you root your phone?. [deleted]. What is a faraday bag?. How and why are they useless?
I had kaspersky and malwarebytes detect an app as malware and they forced me to choose to delete it as well as other options. I deleted it from their on screen prompts. Kaspersky also quarantines apps automatically until I delete it to prevent it activating.
Would that not help?. So if the security app quarantines and then deletes it after scanning it should be fine? As long as it isn't opened or activated?. Would a factory reset and restore be the better option?. Would a factory reset and restore be the better option?. A rom for an emulation (game). No. I'm going off of my experience using Android. I don't know about those extra features or if/how they actually work. But as I've said, the only people who come across malware are the unaware. To me and a lot of other people, those apps are a waste of resources.

Besides, if something extreme happens, Malwarebytes and Kaspersky can't help you, as they are user apps that don't have any system-level permissions.. Because unlike your traditional operating system (Windows) apps don't have access to everything on the phone. They have access to only their files, external storage if you allow it and only a relatively small amount of shared/public info from the OS.

You have to give apps permission to do pretty much anything on Android and even if you do, they can't really actually do anything to your phone. The system partition is completely write protected from anything but the system (unless you're rooted). They also can't leave anything behind without you knowing or allowing the app to install another app.. its useless because it cant do a system wide scan. It can only scan app file directories and user created folders.

The google scan from the play store it self is better then the anti virus apps combined.... still not 100 waterproof tho.

I all comes down to your android version you are running.

Also, most of the time the MD5 ID of a app gets flagged if it contains malware or virus but what if the hack generates a new MD5 id for all new downloads from source x? Then those will not be flagged and still contain the virus :). Seems like a waste of time, similar to when you get leaves in your swimming pool (you wouldn't replace the water in the pool to get rid of the leaves would you? lol).  
If you haven't opened the file there was nothing for it to do.. ROMs are never apps. Apps can be used to run ROMs (like [epsxe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epsxe.ePSXe) and [my boy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastemulator.gba) for example ) but Apps should be used to emulate game systems, not one per game.. Quick question, what about some Samsung devices? Device care has malwarebytes built in, would that not have some advance. I'd imagine that version to be a system level app.

Disclaimer, I don't touch it myself. I'm still curious though, and there might be some who know of it, but won't ask.. Would a factory reset and restore be the better option?. So the security apps are near useless because android already has safeguards? So they're useless, but for a fairly good reason?. Or am I misunderstanding what you said?. OK. Could you suggest what action I should take? The app was deleted by me security app. It was the known 'fakeadsblock' malware. Malwarebytes has a page that explains it.
Is there anyone I can get to have a look at it, like a technician or someone, or anything I should do. I'm on the latest android version with the latsst security pat h on a 2019/2020 device.

And by source would that mean anything downloaded from chrome in future?. Maybe. I'm not sure what that does differently from the app, but I've never seen anyone praising it before, either.. Not necessarily. If a bad app is doing bad things, you can just identify and delete it yourself.

For the extreme cases, system-level malware will survive a simple factory reset. Newer Android versions prevent attacks like that from happening, though. You will be fine.. What sort of phone is it and which version of Android and what's its security patch level? 

There have been some cases of some budget random-brand phones being infected with malware that can survive a factory reset. These phones were running quite an old version of Android that were vulnerable to such malware.

If you're on a recent patch level of Android (any version released this year), then it's unlikely you'll have a persistent malware, therefore a normal factory reset will do the trick and would be the best option. 

I wouldn't recommend relying on third-party ""antivirus"" apps, as they give you a false sense of security. There's no harm in using them for scanning, but as others have said, you'll be better served following best practices such as not installing dodgy, low-reputation apps, avoiding sketchy apk download sites and using a decent adblocker such as AdGuard along with a browser-based Adblock (such as Kiwi Browser + uBlock Origin).

So do the factory reset, make sure your device is up-to-date (this is crucial) and watch what you install. Also, when restoring your data, do not restore any dodgy or suspicious apps - there is no guarantee that all apps on the Play Store are 100% clean, so again, quite important that you stick to well known apps (also, don't rely on ratings and reviews as these can be manipulated - so pay careful attention to the permissions the app requests).. They are useless because malicious apps can already do almost nothing to your phone or data due to the way Android is designed.. then you should be fine when uninstalling the app. You can check all processes on your phone thats running and see if you find anything strange.

I mean, some viruses stay on your phone even after you do a full factory reset so to be 100 sure its gone then you have to flash over the whole firmware again.. Ah OK. Thanks for your replies.. What is a flash over? How is it done and can I restore some apps and personal stuff from both internal storage and sd? Could u get a technician to help out? 

Also the download location is to the sd card, does that change anything?

My device has been acting as normal so far, no lags or drops in performance, does that mean anything or not really?

Thanks for the reply.",1320.0,21,96,1

272,What is the best setup to play video files on a TV?,hcu216,2020-06-20 21:23:13,"From my understanding-

Samsung TVs have the best USB video support, but can't play FLAC in video files.

LG and Panasonic have some support, but they aren't as likely to work.

Sony and TCL don't support mkv at all.

Are there currently any TVs that from USB, play:

10-bit HEVC 1080p video

5.1 channel FLAC audio

PGS or VobSubs subtitles

VLC for Android supports these.

I   tried to find an Android device for decoding video and sending it to a   TV through HDMI, but only found ""TV boxes"", which are used for  streaming  video from online services.

I   just want a TV or box I can plug a USB flash drive into and play video   files, with the level of support that VLC on Android has.",7,1.0,11.0,"An Android TV box like the NVIDIA Shield can playback local files. You can even install VLC.. Not sure if it's possible for you but maybe use some kind of software like Plex that acts like a media server on a PC and transcodes the files on the fly to a format the the playback device can support?. If it's a ""dumb"" TV I'd suggest getting a [FireStickTV](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/) and a [OTG y-adapter cable](https://www.amazon.com/TV-xStream-Adapter-Micro-Cable/dp/B07XLP5DJB/). Put VLC on the 'stick, plug the flash drive (or hard drive if you get a 3-4a 5v wall wart) on the OTG cable and away you go.  
There might be cheaper native support options but $25-$30 for the stick and under $10 for the OTG cable is pretty cheap IMO.  


The normal HD firestick is on sale for $30 currently, the one I linked to is the 4k version.. Personally the best option if you want to play ANY file on a TV is get a PC Stick, like the Intel Compute Stick. There are also cheaper models. No need to worry anymore about any type of file format.. I use an nvidia shield, it plays my h265 mkv files no problem. It should have no problem playing FLAC.

It also has USB ports to plug in external storage. All you have to do is plug it in and install the Kodi app or an equivalent video player.. Thanks, that looks better than the other TV boxes I've looked at.. So it sends a TV a video signal from a computer through ethernet or wifi? That would only work with smart TVs though, right?. That's indeed a cheap option. My brother has a firestick, but I didn't see a USB port. I didn't know there are adapter cables. Well, thanks. I'll consider doing this.. That does seem like the best option. It would also have better compatibility than Android for a lot of things. I wonder how fast it would be compared to firestick and other TV boxes. I'll look into it, thanks.. yes but remember that dumb tvs can be made smart tvs with things like fire sticks (or even gaming consoles), and a quick google search leads me to believe the plex app is available on the fire sticks, so that could still work. Smart TVs are more common than dumb TVs nowadays. All this new tech makes me feel old. I remember when game consoles were offline and you could play multiplayer with a split screen.

I was watching the latest [Mrwhostheboss video](https://youtu.be/165bpjQ2ZNs) and he talked about how instagram have lower quality stories on Android and I guess the same goes for photos taken directly from Instagram app, and started to wondering why on a more technical level and would like to be educated more.

First I understand that Instagram develop for each iOS device and that's why it works better on iOS, and the reason is that there are a lot of Android devices to develop for them all. I understand that, and I'm not saying they should do that . But, why doesn't Instagram, instead of talking to the phone camera directly, talk to the camera app on this phone, I understand that would be a very big hassle again, but it will have to be developed to talk to a number of apps (samsung camera app, Gcam, Huawei camera app, etc) I'm not sure how different each specific app (samsung camera app for example) from model to model, but I think they have the general same export coding (correct me if I'm wrong)? Is this because they won't be able to implement their Ai filter and such on top of it or are there other reasons? and if so, If google would to add a universal G-service that can apply AI to the export of these apps ,providing manufacturer of the mobile write the code for, to work as a middle man between the native camera app ,with all the driver support and such, and Instagram app to talk to Instagram directly without developers of Instagram having to do the heavy lifting, would Instagram accept something like this or will facebook deny giving in for google to handle such processing against giving better quality for Instagram users? also how hard would it be for google to provide something like this service? I mean from what I know apps like uber already uses similar service for location and maps

Finally, I'm not a developer but I want to understand more why the problem that there are too many android phones affects apps like instagram and what'sapp voice notes, but not other apps like apps that rely on haptic feedback for example which are different from phone to phone too. or apps that requires things that vary from phone to phone ?

291,Can apps refuse to let you play if your phone is rooted?,hcnyo9,2020-06-20 15:18:58,notexthere,2,0.67,20.0,"For example, Mario kart Tour looks for the TWRP folder and won't let you start the game (if you rename it, you're good to go). Yes. Google implemented an integrity check into phones called SafetyNet. Apps can check SafetyNet to determine if your device is bootloader unlocked and/or rooted. Some games like Mario Kart or Pokemon Go may refuse to launch if your phone fails SafetyNet. That's why people use Magisk for root. It hides the root from SafetyNet, to allow you to pass its checks. You can also enable Magisk Hide for certain apps to hide root from them more thoroughly, in order to use them.. More on topic, you might need Magisk hide like for banking apps. Just don't use xposed manager that will 100% trip SafetyNet, you need to use something like edxposed instead, always use magisk hide for banking apps and such. I hate all of this. My phone shouldn't give apps any info I don't want it to share.. Haha so if I create the folder, it won't work?

What a bad way to identify root...

Having TWRP doesn't even mean the device is rooted.. So all apps won't detect if I use magisk? Will my warranty still void?. How do you use SafetyNet to check if rooted? I actually want to use this to put a banner for an app that I created, that requires root ([here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lb.contacts_sync&hl=en), if you are curious). Isn't it a part of the file system, making it easy to detect for system apps?. Exactly! But don't tell it to Nintendo🤫. That's the idea. Some apps may need you to enable Magisk Hide for them, but they should work. For example, the Spectrum TV app is pretty thorough in its checks, so I had to enable Magisk Hide for it, and also disable USB Debugging in order to bypass the root checks.

For second question - of course its still void, you still have to unlock the bootloader for root, which voids your warranty (depending on your region). Apps should not have raw/full filesystem access, unless I grant it. 99% of apps don't need this. A backup app might need it temporarily. Importing a file in some other app just needs a handle to a single file after an isolated system UI lets me browse the files.. I mean, it might usually also mean it's rooted, but technically it doesn't.. Not for unlocked OnePlus phones.... Sorry. I don't know about it.. they do-not accept rooted phone in CEX europe :D. No worries I'm just whining. I believe in owners having full control over their computers, and think we need to push back strongly against ""trusted computing"" which really ought to be called ""restricted computing""

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing

If I own the device, I should technically be able to do whatever I want with it, legal or otherwise. There are separate systems in society to deal with cases of illegal activity.

Now, in some use cases restricted computing makes total sense: corporate computers, military computers and other cases where the primary user is not the owner. I have no problem with my employer restricting things on my work computer -- after all, they own it so I believe they can do what they want!

I have a problem with it when we talk about personally owned devices.. CEX?. yeah, its a shop, main one, that sells second hand tablets n eu. fol.. So I guess it's a popular one, if you write it. ok",573.0,12,1,1

295,UK COVID-19 contact tracing app,hcm6p0,2020-06-20 13:20:21," 

Hello everyone,

I'm usually just someone who lurks around this subreddit to read some information regarding android. I've been following UK attempt to implement this system and how they decided to transition to the service Apple and Google are going to provide.

Well, I bought a OP 7T Pro and I found out - because someone I know mentioned it to me - that I have the feature already installed but deactivated (I think) on my phone.

I don't live in the UK, even though my phone came from there. Does anyone (specifically from the UK) also have this feature? Wasn't it suppose to be an app?

Basically, search for ""covid"" on your Android Settings and it should present an option: **COVID-19 exposure notifications.**

Thank you in advance",1,0.57,10.0,"Its being rolled out through Google Play services, iirc theres a second stage to it that improves it.
You can find it a settings [Google](https://i.imgur.com/LqgL5Jq.jpg). What you've found isn't an app. It's the API (Application Programming Interface) for apps to use. So it won't be activated until such time as you install a contact tracing app that uses it.

Basically it's being rolled out to most 'phones as an operating system upgrade so that contact tracing apps can use the Google/Apple API rather than the intrusive and failed system the British government tried to roll out.. It got pushed by Google as security update, it's just APIs so the service is not active until an app requests them. I got Samsung and Nokia on android 10 in uk, nothing on either of my devices and nothing shows in a settings search.. Yea, they have put 100's of millions into this app and then later just moving to the apple/google tracking due to more privacy lol

There is no way to block it since its turned on native in ios and android. Yes I have it on my Pixel 3A XL but it's non functional until the Government rolls out the app. And that will be months away.. *Laughs in lineage os without gapps*. And even then, you'll have to install it for it to do anything.. word, thats the only real fix for now when it comes to on device tracking. They still track the cellphone signal tho but its not very accurate yet unless its 5g :). I usually have airplane mode enabled which which  stop most mobile connections",268.0,5,124,1
296,How durable have your curved screen phones been?,hcm4th,2020-06-20 13:16:25,Please mention which cases/screen protectors you've used.,29,0.91,31.0,"My S8 has 2+ years, never used case and the screen only has some scratches. It has fallen down a lot of times and no problems until last week, when the back broke because a literally 10 cm drop, that was unlucky for me.. Original Nexus 4. No screen protector, no case. 5+ years without problems. Eventually battery gave up.

Galxy S9. No screen protector, no case. 2 years almost without problems.

I don't like cases or screen protectors as you can see... And I like to take care of my phones in their vanilla state!

Edit: both these phones also have a glass back! No visible scratches and no cracks. Yes, they have fallen quite a few times, but have survived those as well as survived being used by a toddler.. Perfectly fine 20 months old s9+ nude. I have an LGV30, it's not quite as curved as Samsungs edge screens but the edges do curve down. 

After over 2 years of use without ever using a case or screen protector (there's a skin on the back, but that offers no protection) it's still mostly fine. There's some light scratches (as expected from using it without a screen protector) and a small bit of the glass on the side came loose (due to a drop), but that's only half the width of the bezel so it doesn't affect usability at all.. I've had the Galaxy S7 Edge for about 4 years (since is eas released). Never have had a problem with the curved screen. I use a Spigen slim case.. I have had an s10 for about a year with just a rubber case and have never had a crack in it. Even dropped it face down on concrete from a meter high and not a scratch. Ive had a couple phones with curved screens and have had no issues. I have always used a rugged case and up until now a glass screen protector. 

Phones have ranged from Pixel 2XL, S10+, S10 5G and S20 Ultra. Knock on tits I haven't broken a screen yet when dropping. I attribute this to a good case. (Unicorn Beetle Pro)

The two good screen protector brands are amFilm and no reason to consider Whitestone if amFilm is available. Both tempered solutions are identical

I've stopped using them because they are a gamble, sometimes you do everything right and they stick fine while other times you do the same thing and they lift. Now I am just using a film protector.. Curved as in samsung edge phones? Or curved like galaxy fold?. I've had the Galaxy Note 8 for over 2 years now and it's held up pretty well.  I originally had an otterbox case when I bought the phone, but I hated that I also had to buy a separate liquid screen protector because it didn't come with one.  I ended up switching to a Unicorn Beetle case because it feels really sturdy.  I would worry about not having such a sturdy case, because I'm clumsy and drop my phone often.  It's survived all the dropping I've done.. S10 Plus with a Samsung made leather cover. No issues whatsoever.. Having never broken a phone, and mostly preferring not to use a case, I cracked 2 S8+ within 6 months. Both were with cases. 

The camera glass cracked randomly on my Note 9 as well. 

I personally don't like curved screens from a usability and durability of point of view.. Cracked from a tiny drop, through the best reviewed tempered glass screen protector on amazon, whichever one that is.

Fucking hate them, worst thing about Samsung phones, including fucking Bixby which can at least be disabled.. I'm a software tester, and worked with a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge at the office for 3 years, and we didn't take care of them at all.

We had a drawer with 10 different phones, and we just drop them there by end of the day like they were made of plastic :P

Also, everyday they were requested by other people in the building to test their software.

In 3 years, not a single problem. No scratches, not cracks, nothing. We had them without protecting glass and without case. They fell to the floor several times (we had carpet at the office, that might had helped).

If a device passes the stress of testing use at an office, its a good device.

Despise the terrible results on JerryRigsEverything video of the Nexus 6P, it suffered the same treatment at the office, and not a single problem either.

iPhone X didn't have the same luck. The paint wore off, glass cracked on first fall, a disaster.. Extremely. I had 2 phones: Samsung S7 for work and BlackBerry PRIV for personal.

Both have tolerated being dropped over 50 times each from average use height. I normally have them in cases, but removed my PRIV from its case temporarily to make it easier to sanitize.

I wrote up a great review of a screen protector I had on my PRIV in 2017 after the screen protector caught a piece of welding slag (inside my pants pocket!), yet the screen was unharmed. That's when I figured out it was such durable glass. That one met an untimely end in a toilet, but it's replacement has been equally sturdy and dropped almost as much.

Since then I have not used and screen protectors, and it makes the screens really easy to clean. I have a bulk case for my phone, very rubbery, but couldn't tell you what it is. We get them by the box at work.

The PRIV case is no longer available, but had a fold-out kickstand that folded flat. It broke, which is frustrating as it's all plastic and not repairable.. I have a galaxy s8 in a tech21 case bought black Friday 2017, I used a screen protector for the first month or so but it wasn't nice to look at so I took it off. I have a couple micro scratches that you can only see if the sun is shining directly on them, but otherwise the phone's been totally durable for me, though this might be due to the case and the fact that I can count on one hand the number of times it's dropped more than a foot or so in the last 2 and a half years. I've never broken a screen till I bought the s8+ and then the s10+. The screen protectors are trash for these phones. I wish they'd go back to flat screens. The curved edge has no perks other then a ""look what we can do"" flex. I have my Note 10+ without a case, Ive dropped it a few times accidentally but there's only minor scratches.

Curved glass is stronger against being crushed because of the dome-like shape but I still suggest tempered glass screen protector and a case if you dont mind the bulk.

Personally I cant stand how bulky my phone is in a case and it seems durable enough to be without one. 3 months so far. i-BLASON, s9+. It makes the phone feel wider, iPhone style. It has an edge that lets you use side gestures comfortably and avoid accidental touches, but also protects the curve of the screen. It has protected my phone of  3 falls from about 4 feet. You can put a picture between the phone and the case and give it a different look as many times as you want. It looks a little bulky, but adds very low weight to the phone. Phones with curved screens are very cool, but I highly recommend using a case, one of those with two pieces.. Same as any phone. Just don't drop it.. BlackBerry Priv, had it since 2016 and 2 warranty replacements (not related to physically damaging screen though) in between. Used the original smart cover case and briefly had a curved ""tempered glass"" protector but went without it after it kept collecting dust and peeling. Screen still good as new since I removed the protector, actually went through a few drops that dented the frame.. The S7 Edge was the first and last curved screen phone that I bought, that thing was more fragile than a radical feminist at Trump's inauguration.. Bruh same. Just 10 cm and a whole back crack.. on wood. If you had minor cracks or scratches in the area it hit, it could have weakened the glass

This is why people suggest cases and screen protectors because glass is glass, and glass breaks. Should look into tempered glass screen protectors because for only 30$ or so you can save yourself from a potentially screen-breaking fall

Usually they're so thin that they dont look different, they're very thin

Understandable if you just dont like to use them though, you clearly take care of things better than I do lol. The edge phones.. A foldable is not a curved screen... Well, the back glass is full of scratches from all the use, drops and being on the table, so pretty sure you're right. 
Want to add that even it is broken now, I loved using it without a case and I still using my phone without one. Broke the shit out the galaxy 6 edge.
From galaxy s7 edge I stopped. Now I have the S10 and had no issue with it at all. I work on a construction site and as long as you won't drop it is fine. 

I quite use the edge display and apps that comes with it. They are handy to have. I keep it in a Spigen thin rubber case. I actually dropped it on its back and still no cracks. But I was just lucky.. It is, whe. You fold it.. My phones have all died from dropping things onto the screen personally  
Until now Ive always cheaped out. A70 died from a 3/8"" steel nut being dropped from around 5-6"". The nut weighed only like 30-50 grams lol

Lesson Learned - No matter how convenient it is to change songs while you work, keep that shit in your pocket. No, that's called a foldable, which is very different from curved screens, you are the only person that doesn't understand the difference",1696.0,8,7,1

Just download naptime and use that trust me that's all you need.. greenify does wonders for me.

Just having aggresive doze doesnt work. Here is what I do.

Add every possible app to greenify. everything except essentials.

Add a 'sleep and hibernate' widget to homescreen. Long press on greenify icon in your launcher, and drag the 'sleep and hibernate' to the home screen. Whenever you want to lock the phone, press that. Not the lock button.

uninstall/disable the google and chrome app if you are not using. They run in the background.. [LeanDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teqtic.leandata) can enable/disable WiFi, cellular data, bluetooth etc for a rooted phone under specified or scheduled conditions. No ads.. Setcpu is to make cpu sleep on rooted phones.. best way is to find out which app trigger the phone and those need to be put in sleep.

Best way tho is to have a custom tweaked kernel. Naptime puts the phone into doze mode immediately the screen turns off right? What else?. Thanks, but my phone use cases vary, I want to put YouTube to sleep for example but I sometimes leave my phone downloading videos so I wouldn't want Greenify to shut it off. What app can I use to check what's eating my battery when the screen is off?. You can remove the Google app? What functionality does that break?. Thank you. Thanks you. I have a custom kernel, what do I do next?. Turn on motion detection and your good to go phone uses little battery when using naptime. If want to save as much battery as possible that's your best bet.. It won't turn off apps that are running in the background.

If it does, put it in 'shallow hibernation'. Only if it does.

You can check what apps are active by opening greenify. None for me, guess it depends what phone you're on, on a pixel it's probably important. I'm on Samsung and I'm doing fine without it. Nothing. Unless you open the app. depending on the kernel.... it might come tweaked out of the box or if you have 1 from a decent developer then it will have its own tweaking app..

They both have desktop clients. Just setup the sync job and your photos show up almost instantly.. You could install [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) on your computer, then it's a single command to transfer all your photos across.

`adb pull /path/to/photo/directory /path/to/backup/directory`. Not free but Google One?. \+1 for syncthing. Easy and solid. If you backup your computer anyways, you pictures will be included, then you got triple safety.

October, while they have Android 10 for such devices as Galaxy A20s(pretty low end phone, a nice one tho), for which they also have Android 11 planned. I still wouldn't hold my breath for 5+ year support like on iPhones, but because Google made it easier to make updates, they may give it more years of support then before.

Also, because it's android, even if manufacturers won't make you a new version of Android, community will, and my xiaomi Mi5(2016 phone) works great on pixel experience Android 10 ROM. If you're into that, you may also want to take a look at project Treble.. The flagships will be the first to get updates of course. They tend to do so the December or January after Google releases their version, with the option to get in for the open beta version by October.

The flagships and higher end phones get monthly security updates, and depending on carriers who might choose to skip or give late. The tablets are getting security updates quarterly.

Google also mandates that all units that sold 100k devices get the updates released until 18mos after launch, so most units will get almost 2 years security updates.

For flagships, they get 2 OS updates (so the S20 that got released with Android 10 gets updates to 11 and 12), and security patches for four years (the S7 got its final security update this year)..

I’ve been noticing that whenever i call with Facetime Audio, there will be times where the call goes silent and/or either the other person’s voice cuts off or they’ll complain i am cutting out. Same happens on whatsapp audio calls too. For Facetime especially, the audio will cut off and then come back a few seconds later but the persons voice will be very sped up (as if its trying to catch up what it missed). For Whatsapp audio calls meanwhile, only the other person will complain im cutting out but weirdly enough i hear them perfectly.

I’ve tried switching headphones and that doesnt help, so i thought perhaps it was my wifi. I’ve basically redone my entire wifi network setup (changing ethernet cables and where the modem connects to first and so on and nothing has changed). Even tried turning off UPNP and DNS servers (which were a few things suggested online) and so on. I can’t think of anything else to change. Could it be my iphone 11 pro itself?

My phone SIM just go back to cellular when i try to make a call with wifi calling (after waiting a few seconds in silence with no dial tone until it switches back to cellular).

I found this by Googling ""iOS show map in location alerts"". Come to think of it, I've never seen any way of seeing a map of locations recently accessed by an app nor have I seen any location alerts.

The request to access the location isn't a location alert. It's just a permissions request.

Perhaps an app developer has to code Location Alerts into the app. I don't know.. I just thought since google maps was an app that was tracking my location I’d get some sort of notification. When I think about maybe I did initially get some notifications at that time but after agreeing with them they got dismissed and never reappeared.. Thanks. The thing is, my “show map on location alerts “ is enabled but I’d not get any notification when google maps is tracking me or sharing my location with someone else. Google maps is the only app that is set to “always allow” location on my device.. Ok thanks.  I think maybe a month ago when I bought my first iOS device I had some notification about google using my location etc. But like you said it wasn’t an image of a map or anything.. This has nothing to do with Google Maps. Read it. It's not a feature for a maps app.. This has me wondering if it's something that either doesn't work, or no developer has taken advantage of (if that's how it works).

From now on though, if I ever see a location alert with a map, I'll definitely think of you and I'll probably rush here to be like ""it finally happened"". lol

Or if it has happened to me before, perhaps I just ignored it and dismissed it.. I’ll read it a few more times. Thanks for your time.. >When you allow an app to always use your location in the background, you may receive alerts about the app’s use of that information.

Apple probably just added additional details for cases where corporations want to add their own root certs 🤷🏻‍♂️. Yea see thats where ya lose me, root certificates? Lol. I have no idea what a root is. But you don’t have to explain if ya don’t feel like it I thank you for taking me this far.. A trust certificate is something that tells your computer that something else can be trusted.

They are issued by a [Certificate Authority ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority).

Have a read, it’s quite a rabbit hole 😉. Fantastic lol, thanks bud much appreciated.. As an example why someone might add a custom root cert, imagine IT runs its own email server.  Rather than get a warning that it not secure, they could either pay to have it added to a public trust store (not ideal, as others might get it by accident), or write their own and add it to devices they want to be able to use it (usually via configuration profile, much better as only devices with the config profile get the trust certificate)

Apple run their own, which contains all the major public trust authorities and they keep an eye on any suspicious activities.

Now I have 5% and am trying to stretch it as long as I can. Apple said it looks like the pins in the charging port that got corroded, not the battery.  I logged on to my cell carriers website to look over my options for purchasing a new one and noticed something strange, under my phone number it had my device listed as an iPhone 8, when I have (what I thought) is an iPhone 7. I brushed this off because it really doesn't matter in the scheme of things, but then I went to my 4th repair shop of the day to ask them what my options are for data recovery, and he said ""Before you have us do anything, have you tried wirelessly charging it?"" and I was very confused because iPhone 7 doesn't have this capability. He told me that my phone is an iPhone 8, because it has the glass back and not the metal. I looked this up and verified that it did in fact look like an iPhone 8 and not the iPhone 7, so I went to Verizon to buy a wireless charging pad. I got home, unboxed the pad, and placed my phone on it and nothing worked. Then I turned on the phone for long enough to open the settings and under ""About"" it was listed as an iPhone 7. Does anyone know why this may be?",1,1.0,8.0,"This is just a guess, but is it a jet black iPhone 7?. What does it say in Settings -> About -> Model Number?. You can see your model number on the back of your phone I think. The number will start with A followed by five numbers. example: A1000.

Put that number in google and you'll find out exactly what you have.. You could also try a little rubbing alcohol on an old toothbrush to clean corroded contacts in the charging port. It may solve your problem. But before doing that, make sure your lightning cable seats flush when inserted into the charging port. Many people don’t realize that pocket fuzz gets compressed and impacted in the bottom of the port over time, causing the lighting cable to not seat fully into the port and the pins don’t make proper contact. I’d estimate 80% of the people coming into my shop with charging issues just need the port cleaned out. 

If the plastic part of the lightning cable is not flush with the phone housing when inserted, there is crap in the port. Another way to tell is if you can’t dangle the phone upside down by the charging cable. There are two spring latches that should click into the side groves of the lighting connector, these will allow your phone to hang upside down by the cord when they are in latched in properly. if they aren’t latched and your phone comes unplugged when dangling from the cord upside down, you have crap in the bottom of the port. I use a needle bent with a slight L shape at the tip to clean out hard packed stuff from iphone lightning ports. Just be super careful to not touch or hook the pins down inside the port. You can also use a plastic or wooden toothpick to be more safe, but I do this on a daily basis and personally prefer to use a sharp, rigid metal tool for hard packed stuff in the port, but just being cautious of where I’m scraping.. This!! The jet black definitely makes it look like glass. Agreed. Jet black i7 can be mistaken for an 8. You can Google “Apple warranty check”, go to that page on Apples website and type in either your imei number or serial number and you’ll get all the info you need. If the phone is dead, your carrier can give you your imei or it may even be printed on the edge of the sim tray.

As for your battery almost being dead, most 3rd party shops can recharge your battery enough to get up and runningmfor data recovery. I also even have gone as far to connect a new charging port to the logic board long enough to just sync data to iTunes or for people to recover photos on devices that they don’t want to pay for a full repair. I install charge ports on 7 and 8 series iPhones for $70 in my shop, it’s definitely reasonable to repair a charge port in most 3rd party repair shops.. Yup, it is jet black and after talking to him again today we both realized it is in fact a 7. Thank you!!!. Thank you for the advice! I went in and had a shop do that earlier today and am currently doing a backup.",559.0,7,260,0

My dad has an iPhone 6S running iOS 13.3.1. He didn't realize that the setting to offload unused apps was on, and as a result, Apple offloaded his password app that had hundreds of entries. The app has since been removed from the App store and isn't available for download anymore.

I think I can restore the app to my dad's phone on my own, but I'm more worried about him losing all the app info. The company who made the phone app also provided a desktop app for backing up the passwords on your phone. Unfortunately, my dad told me that he hasn't backed up the app in quite some time. If it helps, the phone app was called iAccounts, and he had purchased it for $4.99. The desktop app is called iBackup, and they were both made by the company Venticento software design company.

Is there a way to completely restore all the info the app was holding until it was removed? I know I can restore until his last save, but what about the new entries between then and now?

I would really appreciate any advice here. It's kind of a unique situation in that 1) the app isn't available anymore, but 2) it's a password-keeping app.",1,1.0,5.0,"Best to reach out to the App developer.

BUT....Even IF the backup point you’re restoring from had the app not offloaded it’s likely it may not open or work. 

The app would still need to talk to the app developer to work..if it’s been removed it’s likely there’s no server to talk to and your app will just crash.

Regardless if it’s backed up or not. 

iCloud Keychain or 1 Password and many other password managers are the next steps.. As far as I know offloading apps does not delete in app data. Try to redownload it via the App store. Thank you for your response! I actually ended up saving both and app and all of its info (as far as we can tell). 

I have an older MacBook Pro that’s running OS X 10.9.5, which means I also have an older version of iTunes that still has the app manager. Miraculously, all I had to do was plug in my dad’s phone to my laptop, then press “Install App” from the app manager! Somehow, all of the passwords were still there! We’re fairly confident he has most or all of his passwords since he has more entries on his phone than on his desktop app that I mentioned..

Is there any possibility that my media and chats are automatically saved on my Icloud? Where can i see it? 

Can i see it through my apple ID?

Can i have again my old chats on my new future cellphone either with android software or an apple one?

Perhaps sounds kinda dumb but i dont know that much about it.

Thanks :)",2,1.0,2.0,"hi :) you can't remotely backup to iCloud, however you can backup your phone through iTunes, however that will not backup your apps. when you take off your old display and pop on a new one, your data etc will remain (unless you have reset the phone to factory settings, remotely wiped it etc). you can head over to [https://www.icloud.com](https://www.icloud.com) and sign in to manage your account. and yes if you get a new phone apple and android both have ways you can migrate your data as you wish. let me know if this helps :). Thank you so much!! I will surely let you know :)",107.0,3,130,0

You shouldn’t use iCloud, as that leaks personal data.

Upload to imgur, then post a link.. thanks for the info will do. https://imgur.com/6zur6E4. Your iCloud Photo Library seems to be stuck at 1%.

This can happen if you don’t have enough space in iCloud for the entire library.

How much iCloud storage do you pay for?. I dont pay for any actually, i think its the free storage they gave me.. No way your 10Gb photo library is gonna fit in the 5Gb free iCloud storage.

Your iPhone is trying to sync, and every time you clear something it uses that to try and continue to sync photos.

You’ll have to turn it off.. Yeah pretty sure i only got 5gb of free icloud storage. Alright I turned off icloud photos, it deleted 35 photos that my phone couldn’t download. It wouldn’t have completed an initial sync.  You shouldn’t have lost anything.. Im not sure, it told me when i switched it off that 35 high rez photos were uploaded to optimize space and that if i turn this option off it will delete the low rez photos (35) since my iphone cannot download em. so i went thru with it anyways so i can fix this issue. those photos which i deleted still appear in my photo library, just low rez and with a circled exclamation mark in the bottom left of the photo. Huh.  How long have you had iCloud Photo Library turned on?. Are they old ones?. to be honest with you i never messed with that setting so probably since ive had the phone, which would be since december of 2019. no they are photos that are very recent. Ouch.  Yeah, I think it’s one of the options during initial activation.

Not really useful unless you pay for enough iCloud storage to hold it (or keep you photo library under 5Gb). Strange.  Perhaps Apple has changed the way iCloud Photo Library works recently 🤷🏻‍♂️

If you go to iCloud.com (on a computer) they *should* still be present.. i should have probably payed attention to that at the start 😂. ah well its alright, they werent very important photos anways. Do you have an idea why my iphone has over 38 gigs of “other”?. Who reads the instructions these days 😉. Because it’s been trying to complete an iCloud Photo Library sync.

Depending how bad it’s got, keep an eye on how much ‘other’ is being used over the next few days while it tries to sort itself out.... alright thanks for the help, ill let you know if the situation worked itself or not 🤝. just in a few minutes ‘other’ just went down to 23gigs i finally have some room to breathe, thank you! :). 👍🏻

Water killed your logicboard and you are unable to fix the phone.

Water got into your earpiece and is causing bootloop. I would replace the Earpiece assembly and see where it goes. It might work again. Nothing is confirmed when water damage is involved..

82,Main camera auto blurring photos,hdg58u,2020-06-21 22:39:54,"Hey I just want to find out if this is an issue or a feature. I have an iPhone X running iOS 13.5.1. The issue that I have is that whenever I take a photo my phone automatically focuses on a certain spot and blurs the parts that it finds unimportant, I guess. For example, when I take full body photos the phone focuses on upper legs, body, and head, but from knees down it’s blurred, which I find really cool, but the problem is that this happens even if I take photos of some texts written on paper. It focuses about 8/10 of the text but blurs the other 2/10 and makes it hard to read and untidy looking. I manage to fix this only by moving away from the object (for example paper) so the camera focuses the whole thing and then cropping the background.

83,iPhone overheated and now it's acting all weird,hdfdev,2020-06-21 21:52:53,"What's up guy,

I was outside working out and I put my phone on the grass for music and then it stopped cause a message came up saying that the iPhone was overheating. I immediately turned it off and put it back inside. Turned it back on maybe 20 minutes later and it started acting all crazy. I can barely type and things get clicked when I didn't even touch it. Does anyone know an easy fix to this?

Update: It works fine sometimes and then I noticed that if I have my phone on for like 5 minutes, it starts acting up again. I spoke with Apple support and they think the battery is causing it problems but to me it seems like it's the screen acting up from when it overheated the first time.

Final Update: Took it in to a third party phone repair shop and they helped me out and found that the digitizer was messed up. Ended up costing me $150 bucks. Normally I wouldn't go to a third party but all apple stores are closed currently due to covid. Thank you everyone for sharing your input and trying to help me. ",5,1.0,18.0,"[removed]. Is it still warm?. I don't think it is a battery issue. Cause I am always putting my phone on the grass and playing music when I at the park, and it is still fine.  I think your phone was hacked or the iOS system was damaged for some unknown reasons. You should try to reset your phone or use some iOS system repair tools like TunesKit to fix it. Before you reset your phone to factory settings, you should back up the data on your phone.. All the outdoor workouts and I think battery got swole as you in the heat 😂 but seriously the X has a known issue with the logic board design, being dual layered and the solder joints of the connector between the two boards failing from heat and stress. Digitizer failure is one symptom of this connector being damaged, so make sure the repair shop hooks up a new screen to test it for a bit before just assuming it’s the digitizer. I also wasn’t totally joking about battery swell either. The battery can swell from extreme heat and cause pressure on the screen that causes digitizer failure. Any good service tech should know this and check your battery first.. This is such bad advice I had to remove it.. No it's relatively cool now. Definitely wasn't hacked, it absorbed so much sunlight that that digitizer got ruined :( Thanks for your input and help!. It worked for me, sorry😅. Is it still messing up?. It's so wired.  Hope you fix your phone soon\~. what was it?. Yeah, it's randomly now. sometimes it'll be fine, sometimes it will go nuts. It seems like iPhone X had a lot of issues with ""ghost touch"" and the only way to fix it is to go to the apple store. unfortunately, they're all closed in the DMV cause of Covid. DMV?. DC Maryland Virginia. DC Maryland Virginia area/region. If it is the battery expanding an putting pressure on the display from the inside, that could become a fire hazard.

You should get it checked out.. I think they said that cause they ran a diagnostic and i guess my battery failed in their report. It’s max capacity is 80% so it is below their criteria. A battery at 80% is more likely to expand if damaged by over temperature.",394.0,8,195,0

88,Restored iPhone is disabled,hdafry,2020-06-21 17:08:14,"Phone details: 
iPhone 7, purchased in the US; carrier is Verizon. It’s got iOS 13 running

This was my old phone. I restored to factory settings some time ago thinking I might sell it, but instead I am trying to give it to a family member (my dad). 

Once the original factory reset was done, I got the white “Hello” page, thought that was good enough and out the phone in a drawer. 

Yesterday I pulled it out, charged it, and when trying to start the setup process with my dad realized that as soon as you hit the home button the phone started asking for a password. 

It does not accept either my passcode or my fingerprint, and it ended up disabled (wait for 5 minutes message).

Following guides online I have been trying to restore through recovery mode. The process appears to be going - iTunes sees I’m in recovery mode and prompts me through downloading an update (to 13.5) and accepting EULA - but at some point it stops the process and the phone just goes right back to being disabled. It’ll be plugged in and supposedly downloading the update, then iTunes drops the connection and the ‘iPhone is disabled’ message is back. 

I tried getting into DF(?) mode yesterday but wasn’t successful.

ETA: I’ve logged in to my Apple ID and reviewed all my devices, and it’s not associated with my account at all. I’ve been the sole owner of the phone, so it wouldn’t be anyone else’s account or code (and my phone code has been the same for a decade).",3,1.0,7.0,"If you got the “disabled for 5 mins” message, then the passcode you entered was not correct.

Unless you are able to remember/enter to correct passcode, you will get more timers...if you can sign into Apple with the AppleID used on that iPhone, you can release it. Then just restore and it should work fine and allow you to go through the initial setup.. Thanks. I forgot to mention it, but I’ve logged in to my Apple ID and reviewed all my devices, and it’s not associated with my account at all. I’ve been the sole owner of the phone, so it wouldn’t be anyone else’s account or code (and my phone code has been the same for a decade).. The only other option is if you have the receipt showing you are the original owner, Apple can remove the lock. If you are unable to locate that, there really isn’t any other options. The fact that it’s asking for a passcode means that there is an AppleID associated with the device. 

Actually...try restoring (not updating) the device and see how that goes. It will erase the entire device and remove the passcode. If it is still associated with an AppleID, around screen 5 it should prompt for a password and say “Activation Lock” at the top of the screen. If it doesn’t, then it should be good. The type of password it’s asking for is important. It will let you know which way to go. Okay I will give that a try!. If you are attempting to restore/erase a device that you put into “recovery mode” it will more than likely kick itself out of recovery mode before the OS has been download by iTunes/Finder. It will boot back to the passcode screen or disabled screen. You will have to put it into DFU mode for it to remain ready for a restore while the OS is being downloaded..

It suggested the screen was dimming as a symptom of the phone overheating, which made sense because the phone was hot (forgot to add that in my OP, sorry) and I was outside in a heatwave just before it happened. 

I closed any apps I had in the background and let it sit by itself for a while with the brightness down (that I dimmed myself, not the phone) and it looks like it's back to normal. If it does happen again I'll restart the phone like you suggested.

Sorry for wasting your time - when I looked it up the first time I guess I missed the article.. oh yeah that makes sense, the same thing happens in when it ""over cools"". glad to hear it's fixed",230.0,5,109,0
90,[HELP] RECOVERING A PERMANENTLY DELETED VIDEO:,hd6mrq,2020-06-21 13:06:08,A few months ago I permanently deleted a video I took on my iPhone 7 and am just realizing now that I could use it.

93,Desperate for iPhone XS Max recovery mode help. Really appreciated.,hd50w4,2020-06-21 10:51:28," Hello! I am have issues with my iPhone XS Max. It was purchased back in 2018 in the US. (I'm in Australia now) 

&#x200B;

Out of nowhere today, my phone's screen went black and the white apple logo popped up. After a few seconds, the restore screen came on. Since then I have done some research and connected it to my laptop. It wasn't able to either to restore nor update the phone so I tried it with my iMac. I was given the aforementioned options and chose to update. Whilst downloading the update to iTunes on the computer (not yet installing it on the phone) the phone went back to normal and I was able to do a backup to iTunes. After about 30 minutes the phone yet again went to a black screen and the restore screen came back on.

&#x200B;

Since then I have tried to install the downloaded update unsuccessfully, then I tried to do the restore option and none of them have worked. I am getting error 4013. I have now updated my Macbook completely and I am downloading the update again.

&#x200B;

 I have searched on the Apple help forums and here on reddit and I am not sure what to. It is currently still going between the apple logo and recovery screen now.

&#x200B;

I will go to the Apple store tomorrow and if all else fails I will have to buy a new phone regrettably. If there is someone who knows what is going on and can help me I would really appreciate it.",6,1.0,23.0,"[DFU](https://help.ifixit.com/article/108-dfu-restore) 

Try getting your iPhone into DFU mode and proceed as normal with restore when connected to iTunes.

This behaves same as a restore but goes a level deeper and restores the firmware too.

* Top tip for DFU, you DO-NOT want the Apple Logo/iTunes logo showing when it’s connected to your Mac when you follow the steps..

but you DO want your Mac to recognise something is connected when the screen is black. Then proceed as normal as if it’s a restore.

Best of luck!. If u do bring it to the apple store...if you can prove there is something wrong with the hardware aspect of the phone they should give u the same exact phone just refurbished. Some funky shit was going on with my iphone XR once and every time something weird happened i would screen shot it until i had like 20 different screen shots and screen recordings of it acting weird, and that was enough for them to determine something was def wrong with the phone and they swapped it out.. If you’ve tried to update it while it’s in recovery mode, then unfortunately your data is gone. 

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.. The cause of this issue is the Earpiece assembly. Either water got into the earpiece or a hard drop messed something up there. Take the phone apart and disconnect the earpiece and try to turn the phone on again. Will probably boot right up. This exact issue happened with my iPhone XS and the issue was the same. Give it a shot or ask a friend experienced in phone repair.. R/mobilerepair. Don’t bother that phone is gone 4013 is band. Thank you for the reply. When I follow these instructions, the screen goes black then it has the restore screen pop back up (cord plugging into computer symbol, with [support.apple.com/iphone/restore](https://support.apple.com/iphone/restore)) as it has been all day. Frustrated is an understatement! 

&#x200B;

As I was lucky enough to backup the phone today in the short time it was up and running,  I am happy for the staff at Apple to wipe the phone if it means it will be in working order again. 

&#x200B;

Can I assume that the back up was successful if when I go into the devices in the settings for iTunes and see a backup at 1534 today?

&#x200B;

Again I appreciate all the help you have provided.. That won’t work! It’s 4013 NAND issue.  It’s 4013 NAND issue  unless it has Apple care then no. Thank you for your reply. I was lucky enough to backup the phone in the short frame it was working. I'll go into Apple tomorrow and see what they say.. No that’s wrong  It’s 4013 NAND issue  has this so many times. Yes if iTunes has backed up successfully then the time stamp suggests this was captured.

It’s all about timing with DFU and can be frustrating to get it right. But once you get it, it should get you a step further.. How have you come to that conclusion...or should I say LOGIC?. Apple won’t be able to do anything unfortunately.

Since it’s out of warranty they’ll simply offer to replace your device for an out-of-warranty charge at something like $549.. I really appreciate your help. I am ready to throw the phone at a wall at this point. I am hoping with the COVID situation as I was unable to make an appointment that I can get someone in store to give me a hand. Otherwise - new phone for me!. They were able to update the phone and it was working as normal.. Until I got back home. Then it started to flash again and entered recovery mode. I will try to have it fully restored today.. I would say so! Ha. 

Have you got any further?. Just got back from Apple. They were able to update the phone and it was working normally until I walked in the door and of course it starts doing the same thing again.. Was it set up as a new iPhone or did you restore from a back up?. They only did an update in store. I will go back in today and see if they can do a full restore and hopefully that will fix the issue. Please correct me if i'm wrong, but if the phone was working as normal for an hour after the update can I assume that it is a software issue and not a hardware issue? Thank you so much for your help.. It’s hard to be 100% certain. But it is likely it’s software related if you got the phone running for a period of time. 

If it is software it could be an issue in your back up that’s causing it or firmware...DFU and restore from there would fix both of the problems if it was in any of the two...

One way you can check on the device to know if you might run into the same problem in the very near future, once it’s up and running again go to > Settings > Privacy > Analytics & Improvements > Analytics Data and check for anything that relates to “full-panic” or “kernel-panic”.

If you don’t see anything like that...your probably in the clear. If you do, it’s likely the issue is hardware and it’s time to look at replacement options I’m afraid. 

I hope it’s not the latter and again, best of luck!. Thank you! I was able to wipe the phone completely. I finally can use it! I will try this Analytics Data check. 

I hope you have a great day!. Hi! Just wanted to give you an update seeing as you invested your time into giving me a hand.

The guy at the genius bar today told me that the logic board was faulty as when I was putting in the sim card it seemed to enter recovery mode, also confirmed by the green flash on the screen I was experiencing after the apple logo came on.

Unfortunately because I purchased the phone in the US, consumer law in Australia prevents the phone from being replaced for free here. I was offered a new iPhone XS Max (not refurbished) for around $900 AUD. 

I ended up just getting the 11 Pro Max (which to be honest I was wanting anyway)

It's never electrically safe to unplug the power adapter while the cable is still plugged in to both the power adapter and the phone.. I didn’t even know that could happen by doing that! I’ve tried restoring it to no success, don’t really know where to go from here. The electronics for the charging system inside the phone might be fried. I recommend taking it to an Apple store to have them look at it.

There's potentially a huge surge that happens when plugging the power adapter into an outlet (just as with anything). Once it's plugged in though, it's doing its job of providing safe and stable power to the iPhone, which is when it's safe to connect the cable to start charging the phone..

102,Does background app refresh still function when mobile data is turned off?,hcls41,2020-06-20 12:49:37,"**Phone** - iPhone 7, 13.5.1, UK

**Background** - for the last few months I've been chewing through all my monthly data allowance (10Gb) seemingly without noticing, and I'm trying to work out where/how it's happening, since the data use seems way higher than I am actually using.

I turned off mobile data on my phone about 5 days ago, and my phone provider (EE) is telling me my account has used 100mb of data since that point. 

On the data use section of the Mobile Data screen, it's telling me my apps have only used about 500kb of data, including uninstalled apps. So that would suggest:
 
a) The background app is still active, and consuming data even when the apps themselves can't use it.
b) My provider's figures are wrong
c) Someone/thing else is using the data attached to my account.
 
**Question** - So to rule out a) - can anyone confirm whether background refresh stays active and using data even when mobile data is turned off?

Thanks so much!",3,1.0,5.0,"I specifically turned off cellular data for Facebook and it used almost 3 GB afterwards. I just upgraded to the unlimited data until I switch providers very soon.. Instead of using background app refresh, go into cellular settings and pick which apps you want to have access to cellular data.. The problem is, the numbers reported for the apps using data doesn't match the data use I'm seeing.
 
So I've had mobile data (it's called cellular data in the States?) turn off since my data plan reset for the month. Since that point, it tells me I've used 102.4mb of 10gb data, but in the list of apps with access to mobile data, there are only 2 listed as having used any: 'Music' with 360kb, and 'System Services' with 118kb.
 
So I'm trying to work out where the remaining 102mb of data is being used.. Weird! Maybe it was a software update, or a strange software bug.. App updates only happen over wi-fi... it could be a system update happening, but who knows...
 
I think I need to talk to my carrier - the iPhone says that the data numbers are provided by EE direct, so it's possible the number they are reporting doesn't include use on this phone, just the phone *number*. Nobody else has access to the data that I know of...

It didn’t, and around this time I noticed that the back camera wasn’t working either, opening to a black screen (the front camera was fine). I tried restarting the phone and/or closing the camera multiple times, as well as using a 3rd part camera app, but nothing worked. I sort of gave up and continued using the phone as normal. Then, tonight while  I was scrolling through reddit I heard a staticky buzzing sound. It caught me off guard but I assumed it had been from a post I had quickly swiped through, which it couldn’t have been given that it was an image. I kept scrolling for a while after, during which the sound returned twice- one after unlocking the phone to reddit, another after scrolling into a video post, on which the audio worked fine. My phone has also been slower than usual lately despite having more than a third of storage open, but I’m not reading into that too much due to apple’s love of planned obsolescence.

I’m pretty worried about this. I read that the camera issue can be caused by a drop. The last time I significantly dropped my iPhone was over a week before these issues started- it fell 4 feet onto a metal handle with foam covering, screen side down, but was surprisingly OK on the outside due to a screen protector and case. Could this have caused the issue, even a week later? 

Thanks in advance :)",1,1.0,5.0,"The camera’s image stabilization failed. Changing the iSight camera will restore functionality of the camera and flash/LED.. Damn. This sort of this also happened to me today. I woke up and heard a buzzing noise too on my iPhone 11 (iOS 13.5.1). I went out, opened my rear camera and bam, black screen and i can’t turn on my flashlight for some reason. Although, my wide lens is working fine as well as my front camera.. Sorry, like physically replacing it?

Thank you for the response :). Yep. Ok, Thanks again!",90.0,11,306,0

Not a factory. Did you try a hard reset?. I might’ve but how would I do that. quickly press and release the volume up button, then volume down button, then press and hold the power button until the boot logo appears. Been doing this and it keeps boot looping. then I guess you're only left with [recovery-mode or a DFU restore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_svYhAIga2o) (you'll need a computer with iTunes)  I recommend using 3utools.. Don’t have a computer with iTunes am I out of luck?. No, you're not! This can be fixed real quick. You just need a computer, don't worry.. Well I do in fact ll have a computer what should I do ?. Download and install iTunes from [Apple](https://Apple.com/itunes), put your phone into recovery mode, then plug it into your computer and restore it using iTunes. If that doesn't work, you can do a DFU restore. There are plenty of great tutorials on youtube that should guide you through the process..
