To explain exactly, I dropped my phone in some water, basically just the upper part. I took it out quickly, wiped it up and (because I didn't know better) put it in rice overnight. That didn't do anything obviously, so after seeing it wasn't turning on this morning I opened up the back. I wiped the visible water with tissue paper and spent some time drying it with a hair dryer. I then left it open to air dry more for a few hours. When I could see no more condensation anywhere ( like on the lens of the front camera), I tried to turn it on again. 

It turned on fine, but there's an inch or so of water that got in a corner of the display area and it's visible.  I turned it back off, put it on its side on a tissue so the water would have somewhere to possibly come out. 

I asked a phone service out of curiosity if I did the right thing and they just said I should bring it ASAP - now, I don't know if it's cause of course they want to make money or just telling the truth.

I mean of course there are apps in playstore for that but if there is a convenient root solution possible for this that would be great.

The idea is simple. Like you swipe down, you bring down your notification/control center and at the bottom is a brightness slider, instead or just add an option for volume slider. Like in IOS control center. 

Now i can't use the typical iOS control center thing on my phone since I'm using OP6T android 10 oxygen os. Gesture based navigation (with swipe from left/right to go back)

I would always prefer a volume slider instead of a brightness slider or just an option to add two sliders.


The thing is, i hate using buttons, additionally i have a hard case on my phone so the buttons are hard to use.

I wish to operate my phone without any buttons, at all, i can open and close the screen, but there are times like i could adjust volume while listening to music, since Spotify doesn't provide that. 

This maybe a small thing for most people but this is exactly why i would've loved to use an iPhone 8 atleast. When you could easily access all your needs by swiping from bottom.

Its hard to imagine how everyone feels fine with this? No one genuinely cares about this? Especially those who have bad volume buttons or broken buttons. I hate to rely on buttons. This feels very, ancient. Especially when you have long phones, to reach the top with your finger in long phones is quite an inconvenience.

This is of course a very first world problem, but i guess in a world where people are trying to make everything as convenient as possible.. why not this?

So i tried  flashing the frimware (using odin 3.14.4)

Side note: i am unable to boot up the phone therefore can't access the buildnumber and idrk the phone's country

Phone model on back side: SM-G935FD

Odin mode (download) page details:

Download speed: Fast

Product name: SM-G935F

Current Binary: samsung official

System status: custom

FAP lock: ON

Secure download: enabled

Anyways i have tried these frimwares

G935FXXS8ETC3\_G935FANP8ETC1\_ANP||--||G935FXXS8ETC1\_G935FOXA8ETC1\_BTU||

G935FXXS6ESH5\_G935FOJV6ESH5\_THR => this one is older so it didnt work anyways

So the two mentioned above will always get stuck on system.img and will fail.

Any ideas will be appreciated, Thanks!

Updates:

Used Latest firmware for G935FD, gets stuck on system.img

Tried using USB 2 => No diffrence with USB 3

still haven't tried another cable

Tried on another laptop => Still gets stuck on system.img

Have tried other versions of odin",,2,1.0

Because of the growing tech, I'm so confused where to start with, I'm sure this is not a common syndrome, y'all must have successfully gone through times like these, kudos to you there!

I was taught C and Python at my university. After a bit of research, I have planned to start learning JAVA, and Android Studio. But my bad the internet has a lot of information, sometimes it's scary. I happen to come across ReactNative, which is definitely a cool platform to build applications with.

I'm sure there will be many more out there, I'm not preferring to learn Kotlin, I made my mind to learn either Java or ReactNative.

But here comes the problem, which one to use. If I had to use just Java and Android Studio, that would be great for me, but what about Cross-platform issues, I mean if I had to make my App available for iOS, etc, what framework would help me if I use Java. I got to know I can use Flutter with Dart. But that doesn't help my problem out, because without learning Java it is not easy to learn Dart/Kotlin.

Can someone share their experience, Also I'm confused about which resource should I learn Java/Android Studio.

Recently my friend told me about problems with apps (mainly banking apps, but also some other apps) -- some of them refuse to perform some operations (or refuse to work at all) on AOSP-based or rooted firmwares. Some of them just check for root, while others also check for custom firmware (like LineageOS). I'd like to note that it's not like VLC on desktop that can be compiled to refuse to run as root -- these apps refuse to run if the user isn't restricted enough on their own device.

Some people say that ""itsforsecurity"" -- but desktop operating systems give you root (or administrator in Windows) during the installation process. Why are desktop versions of these same applications that don't run on rooted mobile devices, don't care about root on desktop?

My list of pending updates just keeps growing because it's so hard to deal with.

There has not been a system update for around 6 months, so it doesn't make any sense for a system app to start crashing recently.

The tablet is very intentionally not rooted (if that's even possible), I bought it for the purpose of playing games I can't play on my rooted phone. 

Some things I have tried:

* Force stop the Play Store and re-launch it: Helps with downloads stuck at 100%, but not any at a lesser percentage.
* Stop and Clear data for the Play Store
* Stop and Clear data for the Download Manager: Sometimes helps, but not often enough. If I don't stop the Play Store this also brings up a ""can't download"" error, but that doesn't change anything.
* Stop and clear data for all three of Play Store, Download Manager, and Google Play Services, then reboot: Still happens.

I thought it would just restart, so I took it out the case and let it do its thing. It didn't restart, but turned off, and now won't boot properly.

When I hold down the power button, the One Plus bootloader comes on for a few seconds then disappears. 

When I hold vol up+boot, I go into recovery mode with the options to: START. Restart bootloader. Recovery mode. And Power off.

When I select Recovery mode, nothing happens after the initial loading screen. When I select Restart bootloader, I'm met with ""Fastboot mode"" and I'm taken back to the recovery mode options.

When I press power off, the phone simply goes black.

When I press start, the loading screen appears, but nothing after that.

191,how to automate or silently configure device?,haossk,2020-06-17 10:43:19,"Hallo,

I'm a big fan of all possibilities to automate things so that I can prepare some script or configuration file and then use it multiple times to achieve reproducable results.

I'd like to do some configuration after the initial setup, or maybe even automate the initial setup completely by providing necessary stuff in a response file.

It is so great to setup Linux or Windows unattended, and I'd like to do the same for my family's smartphones. Android does this - to an extent - by offering to restore from a previous device setup, but this option leaves out the most (for me) tedious task: setting up multiple email accounts.

What I mean is setting up the account, WiFi, and some more like setting some particular config items for the keyboard, display, notifications, ringtones, some privacy settings, more email accounts.

I tried Google Business G Suite but (to my understanding) explicitly says it does not push sensitive information like passwords - but that's exactly what I'd want to do - fully configure email accounts including pop/imap/ssl/smtp/password settings.

Is this feasible? When searching the web I find a lot of automation tools but for operating, not for setting up.

I'm not sure if it's a generic Chinese product or a specific OEM; it comes with [MobiControl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.soti.mobicontrol.androidwork&hl=en), apparently some kind of corporate access application, and that makes me think it was originally intended for staff use at some office or something and might have been purpose-designed (or at least purpose-configured out of the factory).

It would appear to be new old-stock as it still has the factory protector on the screen and no scratches whatsoever.

It comes with a few basic application, but the Play Store is not present. This is a situation I've found myself in before, and what I usually do is go to APKMirror and download the latest Play Store APK as well as the latest Google Play Services. Once both are installed it usually works.

Not this time, though - I just get the ""sign in"" button that doesn't work and a three-dots menu that gets me in a very sparse settings menu if I click ""settings"" and crashes the play store if I click ""updates"".

This isn't going to be some hacky performance machine, just a light-duty tab for watching films and occasional light Internet use, so worse comes to worst I can just sideload everything off of APKmirror - but that way I wouldn't get any updates unless I downloaded everything manually every time, which I can *not* be arsed doing.

(Apologies for the formatting. I am on mobile)

So, not gonna lie, I was browsing a rather sketchy video site in chrome. No, it wasnt PornHub. It was a """"""Free"""""" video site where you could watch and download pretty much any kind of video from any website or streaming platform (YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, Disney+, ~~OnlyFans,~~ HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, Snapchat, etc. etc.)

As I was browsing, this download prompt from Chrome popped up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"". I already know that Flash doesn't have an Android app nor does Android does need an app for viewing flash content. So, I basically said ""FOH"" and clicked cancel. A short while later, another download prompt showed up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk"" as ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" already existed.

Obviously, I clicked cancel again, closed the site, backed out of Chrome entirely and began searching through my files. There was nothing in my downloads folder that was named ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" at all. There were, however, three randomly named ""part"" files in there which were created literally a minute before I started looking through my files (according to the details at least).

So I deleted the three part files and, to be on the safe side, I decided to revist the site to see if I could retrigger the download prompt. I know, that was probably stupid, but again, there was no ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" in my files, only the three last files. I figured that if it came again asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" then I'd know I got rid of it by deleting the part files.

But, when I went to the site again, the download prompt came up asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk."" instead. I NOOOOPED out of that again, closed the site, closed Chrome, and forced stopped Chrome.

So here is where my problem comes in.

I checked my downloads folder again and it's completely empty. I enabled ""Show Hidden Files"" and nothing comes up. I went and searched through the Chrome app data on both my phone and my SD Card and still nothing.

I opened up Chrome again and checked the download history and strangely enough, there was a ongoing download for ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" that I most certainly did NOT agree to. Chrome said that it was ""downloading"" the file and had downloaded 11.8MB out of 11.8MB. It seemed to be stuck trying to finish downloading the file, however. I watched it for like 30 seconds and it never seemed to finish. It also had the broken thumbnail icon next to it that (at least from what I've seen) comes up when Chrome tries and fails to download something or the file it downloaded is no longer in the folder Chrome downloaded it into.

There was an X next to the download that I clicked on to cancel the download, which it did, thankfully but it also just removed it from the list without telling me where it was downloading from or to.

I get that I'm probably, for all intents and purposes, fine since it looks like I interrupted it mid-download but I NEVER agreed to download this thing (Chrome didn't even let me know it was downloading the file) and that has me concerned.

What else can I do to make sure that this thing is legit gone?",,2,0.75

I have been wracking my brain over this for two days now, and I've decided to just ask the question. 

Backstory: My best Bros birthday is this weekend, he has kids and thus cant enjoy gaming as he once did. He plays teamfight tactics and legends of runeterra.

Now the question/issue, the first game Teamfight tactics can only run on a 64bit OS. So I was looking into a Samsung tab a 10.1, but after reviews I saw it was ""64-bit ARMv8-A(32 bit mode). As I do not have any tablets with this chipset/bit OS. I am unable to test. 

Could someone explain the difference in the ""32-bit mode on a 64 bit OS"", and just a 64 bit android OS?

Also since it says 32 bit mode does that mean it has the libraries to run 64 bit apps, meaning the mode auto switches?

I have a TCL Smart TV with AndroidTV 9 and with built-in DVB-S2/T card, everything works as was mentioned but the native app to manage my satellite/antenna channels sucks and you can't personalize on it. I did some research and I found this company named TARA Systems and they developed this really powerful App called LiveOn TV to manage your channels and with a really cool UI and much more stuff but unfortunately I didn't find a way to download it because they only work with OEMs.

Question 1: Is there any other app that can do the trick like this LiveOn TV app?

Question 2: If you have a link to download the original LiveOn TV app from TARA Systems or you know how to purchase it or something please don't hesitate to tell me.

Android: version 10

After a recent update, my schedule text message feature quit working correctly. I have many health issues and heavily rely on this feature to communicate with my family. If someone could help it would be so appreciated.

The problem: The texts now send at random times as opposed to their scheduled times. For example, if I would schedule three texts at 7:00, 7:01, and 7:02, respectively, they would each send at that exact time. Now they might send at 7:06, 7:15, and 7:24. Basically the pattern has been: first text sends at completely random time, then each subsequent text schedules nine minutes after the last one. 

I also used to schedule three texts at one time, say 10:00am, but instead of all sending at 10:00 like they used to, they all break up and send at random times as well. Depending on what I'm trying to communicate, it's important they get sent at specified time.

I've used this feature for years on all my previous phones and this one, never a problem until last update.I can't find anyone to help because most people didn't even know this schedule text feature existed, even though its been available for quite some time.

Since I have updated my Xiaomi MI A2 to Android 10 in January earlier this year, I am experiencing issues with my mobile network.

My carrier actually uses the network of another carrier, so in order to have mobile data working properly, a user has to:

1. enable roaming
2. turn off automatic network selection and select the carrier, which provides the network for them.

The problem appears when I want to turn the second option off. My phone returns me a message, saying: ""Couldn't find networks. Try again.""
I was able to make this change on Android 9, but since the phone has been updated, the network selection just does not work for me.

Looks like I am not the only one experiencing this issue. Another user, who owns a different phone and the same carrier  has also reported to me that he had very similar issues after updating to Android 10

My question is, whether anyone has experienced same issue after updating to the latest version of Android and if anyone knows what could fix the issue apart from downgrading the software.

It has good specs for its price here in Pakistan. (specs - [https://www.gsmarena.com/infinix\_note\_7-10175.php](https://www.gsmarena.com/infinix_note_7-10175.php))

However, there is one thing that is bothering me - it has a resolution of 720 HD, not 1080 FHD. Even my old Honor 6x has FHD 1080p.

My question is that in 2020, is this a major downside to buying a phone ? I want to watch youtube videos and netflix shows on it, so will it affect my viewing experience ? do videos of 1080p and above hang up on 720p phones ?

Do you think this display will go obsolete in two years ?

Please guide me if I should go ahead and buy it or not. Thank you.",,1,1.0

324,Internal mic on Bluetooth,h9ejxa,2020-06-15 11:33:48," 

Hey! I have a problem

# The problem

  
So the thing is that I have a Bluetooth headphone but its microphone is so horrible people can't understand me if I use it. So I'd like to use it only for output, and internal microphone as input on Discord.  
I know there are a lot of threads about this but either they don't work for me or there isn't any solution on it.

# Solution #1

  
I thought about installing pulseaudio but  
\- it doesn't seem stable  
\- I don't know if it could allow me to do this (could it?)

# Solution #2

  
I also thought about another solution which could be disabling external microphones making them unusable at all, but I don't know if it's possible, and if it is, how?

# Solution #3

  
I also thought about preventing Android to detect the microphone on the headphones, making them recognized without microphone.

# Solution #4

  
Or I could make an application which allow me to do it, but how? Is it possible? It doesn't seem to be.  


I'd really like to find a solution because for the moment I use WO Mic to use the phone as a microphone for the computer and make my calls on the computer, which is not normal as a device under linux should be able to do what I want without problems, computers do it!",,1,0.67

So this first started on June 8th.  After I sent a message with a Youtube link in it, I never received any reply.  Turns out they never got that message.  On top of that, when I look at that message thread, it is titled ""No recipients"" instead of their names, and in the people section there are no names, just says add or remove people.

Weird, but whatever, I just make a new group and add them all in.

356,Kinda Nervous--Two versions of Google Photos on my Phone?,h93m14,2020-06-14 22:50:15,"*EDIT: Problem solved. It was a shortcut to the web version.*

I don't normally launch apps from my app drawer, as all of the major ones I use are shortcuts in folders in my homescreen tray.  With that said, I was browsing through my app drawer to see if I could free up some space by uninstalling apps, and I happened to notice two different Google Photos apps--one called **Google Photos**, and one called **Photos**.

I have the **Photos** app as a shortcut on my homescreen, so that one looked normal to me when I opened it.  I then opened **Google Photos** and things looked...a bit off.

There was a launch screen with the Google Photos icon on a white background (my phone is set to dark mode), and it said ""Google Photos"" at the bottom of the launch screen in Roboto Condensed, black font.  I know Google uses that font for things, but it just didn't seem ""Google official"" because I also know they don't use black text on their launch screens, and any font would be Product Sans.

Opening the app looked pretty official.  All of my photos and videos, even ones I had taken just minutes before, showed up, and the menu on the side had all of my regular account settings.  Aside from the fact that it wasn't in dark mode, everything there looked legit.

I went back to my app drawer, long tapped the **Google Photos **icon, and looked at the version.  Version 82.  The official **Photos** app I have is 4.51.0.315203446.

When in the info screen, I saw that the **Google Photos** app did say it was installed from the Google Play Store.  When I tapped that, it took me to the store, but it could not find the app.  I immediately uninstalled it, ran SD Maid, and then came here to post.

There were too many strikes against the **Google Photos** app to make me comfortable.  It had a slightly different looking splash screen.  It didn't follow the dark mode theme of my phone.  It was version 82.

I very rarely download anything on my phone maybe other than menus from restaurants, and I don't browse any sketchy websites.

Has anyone else been experiencing this? More importantly, can anyone tell me how to fix it? I like the idea of Android messages, particularly because they'll go through wifi, and I'd prefer not to turn it off if possible.

360,Install Android on Acer Aspire laptop,h927ps,2020-06-14 21:32:18,"Hi, I’m trying to install Android on an older laptop but I just can’t get it to boot. 
The CPU is AMD A4-6210, which is sse4.2 compliant 
I’ve tried android x86 64 bit from Fosshub and I’ve tried prime os.   With prime os it just crashes right away with a kernel panic and just skips right back to the installation menu after doing nothing.   With the fosshub I can’t get it to boot. With uefi enabled in the bios it says no bootable device.  If legacy set in the bios it fails with a grub error 17.  I tried booting from the thumb drive boot and see if I can fix it somehow but there are no working commands it seems from the boot thumb drive.  (I was trying lilo). 

Is this possible?  Do I need a special build for this? The hard drive has no partitions on it except the one I’m trying to install Android to.

369,-repeat- could my android have malware or been rooted without me knowing?,h8yhvm,2020-06-14 18:03:07,"I was looking through a younger siblings tablet the other day and I found a folder called ‘data’ then another folder called ‘data’. once you clicked it the top where the names are of the things you have been clicking is the name of a game in the format of ‘com.—whatever game—‘. the folders in the second ‘data’ folder were two folders named ‘head’ and I believe ‘service chat logs’. in the folder ‘head’ there were selfies of maybe five different people and two pictures that weren’t faces. The beginning of each of the pictures begins with either cache or cached and random numbers. two and a half years ago I used their tablet to go onto a chat app I frequently went on, since my phone was broke at the time. I can’t say for certain, but one of the photos looked kind of familiar, but as I said I can’t be for certain. the others I don’t really recognize.

When I tried to click the two files in the ‘chat service logs’ which were named that as well, I didn’t see their full names but they at least began with that. They couldn’t be opened due to I believe not having the app installed. I deleted that app on their 2+ years ago. I just wanted to bring this up because if it was from my app, why would it be under a folder that doesn’t have the apps name? also no other things were available in the data folder. I read online and saw that if you can access the two data folders that your device is rooted? I doubt a five year old could root a device, unless by accident? my other sibling took the sims card out a few months ago, could this be the reason? I just wanted to make sure there was no malware or anything that could have had access to the camera or microphone. that’s really the only suspicious stuff I saw. I believe we have always had that little box not clicked that says if we want to allow other apps that aren’t from google play. so I don’t think it was an outside app, but my sibling would sometimes play low quality games that I think were tailored to kids due to the amount of ads they would throw in. if anyone could give any insight that would be great, thanks! sorry for the repeated posts, but stuff like this scares me especially if there was the ability to access the microphone or camera without our knowledge.",,0,0.33

I live in America, use Cricket Wireless, and I have an LG X Charge purchased December 2018 and running Android 7.0. I just need to know whether or not this is a 64-bit device. Niantic, the company behind Pokemon Go, is [dropping support for 32-bit phones](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/11/pokemon-go-is-dropping-support-for-32-bit-android-phones/) at the beginning of August. It may seem inconsequential, but Pokemon Go has become a huge part of my life over the past year and a half. It's the main way my partner and I make time to spend with each other, a way we can go out and enjoy ourselves without spending money, and the cornerstone of our main group of friends. So losing access to it would be a pretty big personal blow, and I want to know if I can keep my current phone (which is just chugging along no problem, wasn't even going to replace it until next year at the earliest) or if I should start saving up now for a new one.

I'm on a super strict budget, so my phone was deliberately pretty low-end. I checked the specs of it to try to figure it out, and the LG X Charge does appear to have a 64-bit processor. But, I was told to use AIDA64 and look for ""x64"" or ""-64"" in the kernel version, and I was told my phone would not be 64-bit if it wasn't there. It isn't, which just confused me. If it's that my phone is 64-bit but my current OS isn't, is there a way that I could get my current OS to be 64-bit, or am I just out of luck? Thanks so much in advance!

How do i patch the boot.img file before flashing to phone?  I know of Magisk but this needs to be installed on the phone and it only patches the current boot.img installed on the phone not one on a computer before loaded to phone.

Sorry to sound like an idiot. I have rooted a phone before ( Moto X Pure )
and it worked well.
This phone tho is newer and uncharted territory for me. There were programs and such for the X Pure
when i did it. This seems to be a command (adb) process only.

Finally, is there a different logo.img I can use ( I assume this is the boot animation file). Is this done via adb commands? 

I honestly do not want to brick this phone by being stupid. When I had my other phone TWRP was a breeze but this phone will not work with TWRP.

 I found these directions and got up to this point but confused from here on

 It is the time to start Magisk Manager v7.5.1 on XT2027-3 and choose Patch Boot Image File option to create the magisk_patched Boot Image File.

10. It is essential to select the stock boot img file that you have transferred to your XT2027-3.

11. It is the time to copy the magisk_patched Boot Image File from XT2027-3 to your desktop.

12. It is essential to put Motorola One Hyper (XT2027-1, XT2027-3) into fastboot mode.

13. It is the time to install magisk patched Boot Image File on XT2027-3 using the following command.

Magisk 7.5.1 on my phone has NO option to pick a boot.img file only INSTALL and that is it

I think it's worth it lol.**

Hello my fellow android users!

I am not too deep in rooting my phone or something, but I use an android. Now, I have tried an iphone, and did not like using it. the OS is just bad.. There are a lot of reasons to choose an android over an iphone, but when I try to write them.. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I can't do it.

I live in Israel (Don't Involve Politics Please...) and In Israel, if you don't have an iphone you're basically a loser.

Apple took over in the subject of phones. It drives me nuts when someone who doesn't know anything just tells someone to buy an iphone and to throw that phone in the the bin.

I am not hating on Apple but I do hate like, 90% of their users. What I find is that the people with iphones are always the basic people, sometimes I find them just less intellgient (At least in my state) Not because they are using an iphone but I feel like it says A LOT about their personality, just basic people. I also seriously find the people who use reddit in Israel (not many) to be the same kind of people who use an android.. like, it's hard to explain but that's just how it is.

Also, most of the people who use TikTok are that type of iphone people! just, less smart... idk.. I often see a video on there that shows something that I understand how it is done, or that is fake or false and no one in the comment section is getting it.. For example:

""The man who didn't eat in 40 years, and is still alive!!"" and the whole comment section is like WHATTTT how?? so cooll!!

And it's obviously not possible.. I would give many better examples but I can't think of anything right now.

And about tiktok, I do use it and I think it's a fun app, I know reddit hates tiktok but it can be really fun, the app is not bad, it's working great, and my first impression when trying it was, Ok that, that's not bad.. There are cool options, the app is smooth, works perfectly and I barely see room for improvement.

(That's if you are putting aside the crap optimization for filming with an android phone)

Oh and, to put the iphone vs android thing in perspective.. there is that kind of video with:

""ok (thumbs up) not ok (thumbs down)"" and there was one sound that girls In israel used (reacting to) and It was like, ""He is great and everything but he has bad teeth"" (like 70% of the girls made the sign of not ok)

He is great and everything but he is jealous (Most girls went with ok)

and then, ""He is great and everything but he uses a samsung"" (like 80% of the girls went with not ok)

(Not ok means not gonna want as a boyfriend)

I watched like the top 50 videos with this sound, and as I said, 80% of girls went with not ok.

This. This is the type of a personality I am talking about.

It's just like, I imagine the girl I would date in the future to be from the type of people who use an android.. I don't know how to explain it. Maybe it is just in my state, I don't really know. Maybe what iphones has become made the group of people that do use an android to like, belong to that group of people? (Which I seem to like more and want to be friends with) (Not that I hate my mom or sister who owns an iphone but you probably get what I'm saying)

Anyway, there's a dude in my class who has an iphone 11 Pro and basically acts like he a king, and he thinks there is absolutely nothing that is close to his phone in terms of, like, begin a good phone, you know. In the mind of most people today in the community in my state android=garbage (Oh and also they say iphones vs samsung, they do not know about the existence of other android phones)

I feel like I need to write a text with the benefits of an android phone over an iphone, And I truly believe there are many, but I just can't seem to ducking do it. I need to send it to him, and to know it in generel lol.

Does anybody have like a text about that? I'd love to have a link to it.

Android is great, it's better in my opinion but although I believe there are many good things to it, I can't find more than 3 words to say. I really need that for an argument, Please ? :)

Oh and again, not hating on Apple, when they do things, they often make them just magically. and they did develop some cool stuff.

Sorry if there were English mistakes, I don't listen to the teacher in my English class since about 6th grade. I am learning mostly from browsing the web\\Playing Minecraft (No joke) And I am Still better than all of the kids in my class.

449,[Help] My mum's LG Rebel 4 shr uses through Simple Mobile upon bringing it home yesterday after an outing with my sister no longer connects to the network nor shoes it has a SIM or / IMEI number which I need to talk to her provider for help. What could have happened?!,h89epk,2020-06-13 15:17:51,"Hi all!

I've never had to post here and hope I am in the right place. But I am completely lost on how to fix my mums phone after exhausting the only ways I know of solving such an issue. 

So, long ass story as short as possible. 

My mum has an LG Rebel 4 bought through Simple Mobile as a gift. Not what I would have gotten her but I have an impulsive sister I'd like to murder right now. 

Yesterday she left and the phone was working fine. I even called her on her outing to see how she was. 

Jump three hours and I call to check on her again and get her voicemail. I now assume the battery suddenly died or my moronic sibling intentionally powered off the device. 

One hour later she comes home. I said I tried to reach her multiple times but she never got any calls and the phone was ON. 

What I found wrong and tried

She has no connection to her network. No data usage what so ever. It would not even let me turn the data properly on. It says on but I have no access to APN ( which I first thought was the issue because she never updates her phone and that was what I was trying to do as it has happened to me before). No success. Also can not update at all even when connected through WiFi. 

It can no longer  receive calls or make them nor can it send texts or receive them. Just suddenly?

So I have decided to call Simple Mobile which I am about to do but they asked in the prompts for the IMEI number. When I went to the Info for her phone there is no number listed where it is supposed to show the phone number connected to the device;  it also says ""Network Unknown"" and I briefly received a message I believe saying it could not fins the SIM (It came and went quickly.)

I have not tried a factory reset because it says all data in the phone will be lost but my concern is that if I do that all info about the phone will be erased from when I entered it to set up the phone in December. 
This is also a last resort and I have never had to do it with any of my phones or devices before. I am as you can tell not well versed in this kind of tech, I am in other areas but phones have always baffled me.

If any of this makes sense to one or some of you, any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

How does this happen in the course of 4 hours?! I don't even understand it. It seems ludicrous to me. My mum is also not tech savvy and does not ""mess about"" with anything she doesn't know how to use properly first. Basically just the  browser and apps and such. 


Side note: Even as it is my mums phone my sister uses it when they are together almost daily. She deletes anything she does or tries to with little success. Could she have wiped or disconnected the phone from the network by accident?",,1,1.0

I have a problem with my year old Xiaomi A2 Lite.

In example I use a lot of youtube and instagram, I play something on youtube then switch to instagram, then back to youtube and it gives me the home page instead of the video that I was watching.

I wasn't running any apps to make it overheat and it was just the charging port area that was super hot. It seems to be working fine now but I was wondering what could cause the end of the charging cable to generate so much heat?

479,Ways to offer secondary verification of authenticity of an Android app,h80riv,2020-06-13 04:45:16,"I know a lot of FOSS projects publish to f-droid and that has a great system of using PGP signatures to verify the APK files.  What I'm curious about is how to verify apps deployed from the google playstore.  Now obviously PlayStore verifies the apps submitted but on more than one occasion, phishing apps that share a similar name have remained up for days.  Here are a few ways to verify the apps, that made sense to me.

1. Publish in your github repo, the full and proper playstore ID of your app
2. Publish in your github repo, the public key cert used to sign your app in playstore
3. Publish in your github repo, the full APK of your app via releases mechanism

\#1 is the simplest but isn't really cryptographically hardended.  Just makes sure the users type in the same URL you tell them to and hope there is no DNS hijack other exploits at play.

\#2 is nice since it is trivial to extract the signing cert from an installed APK and the cert fingerprint can be verified against the one in the source repo.  The signing cert never (or should never) changes so there is little maintenance this creates.  And finally, most any JDK / ADK install will be able to verify an APK against a given cert.

\#3 is probably the most complete since the user can checksum their installed APK against the one in the source repo, or simply install the one listed in the source repo.  This does put extra work on the developer since they need to remember to publish a release via github whenever they push a releast to Google.

I know it's paranoid, but there are some bitcoin Android apps that might warrant a heightened sense of paranoia.

I bought a ""new"" oneplus 7 pro from a chinese reseller.  
After opening the box I immediately understood that the phone was actually refurbished (marks showing the box was already opened, charging cable not nicely packed, with signs of previous use).  
The phone is in pristine condition so I see no real problem here.

The problems came later. The phone was already booted and waiting for me to start with the setup. I set it up, everything worked fine, until I tried to start netflix which told me the phone was not compatible. I wandered around on the internet and saw that it may mean that it has been rooted or the bootloader has been unlocked. I'm not too bad with IT but I've never rooted any of my mobile devices so it's a bit outside my domain of expertise. I also saw that GPay doesn't work on devices with bootloader unlocked so I tried to set it up and it failed.

At that point I rebooted the phone, and I saw the start-up warning that the bootloader is unlocked on this phone.

Is there a way that I can put everything back as factory-settings?  
Which means re-locking the bootloader, making sure nothing else has been tampered with, that I have the default manufacturer OS, and enjoying the full-on android experience with none of the drawbacks I mentioned?  
How? (I don't care about loosing any data)

I got a really tricky one and I've spend hours trying to figure out what to do, though nothing worked so far.

**Basic Data**: 

* Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016)
* Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop)
* Security Patch 1. November 2017

**The Problem**: The device is unable to connect to Google thus I'm unable to access the PlayStore. This is necessary since Whatsapp refuses to work until I update it to a more recent version.

Also Ive pulled some Updates and they went through flawlessly, but the phone stayed on 5.1 (saying its all up-to-date), eventhough the Internet says the J3 is upgradable to 7.1

**What I tried**: First I was thinking about readding the Google account, so I focused on that part. I restarted the device, cleared the cache of PlayStore, GooglePlayServices (GPS) and Download-Manager. Since that wasn't working I deactivated the GPS and uninstalled all updates of it reseting it to the factory version in the process. Normally this is fine as there isn't any crucial data stored in the GPS-Data. But then things got really weird. When I activated it again I recieved permanent crash-notifications of GPS. Re-Adding the Google-Account was also impossible as it just stayed at the first ""please Wait""-Screen while spamming the crash-notifications.

At that point I decided its no use and would be easier to just backup all data and reset the phone. Even more so as there really isn't much data on the phone. Just Contacts, Pics and Whatsapp.

Backing up Pics and Contacts is easy enough, but I can't get a backup of whatsapp. I managed to access whatsapp by disabling all outgoing connections and turning back the date to a date where it was still working. Once inside I turned to settings>Chat>Chat Backup and hit ""Backup Now"". A few seconds later it said it wasn't able to backup the chats to drive (which is expected and perfectly fine, since I just want a local Backup). The time of the last backup also got adjusted to the current time. When I checked the local storage under Whatsapp\\Backups i just hat two backups called something with settings and something with stickers, both with less than 1MB, so definetly not the chats. While looking for the Chats I found something in Whatsapp\\Databases. There was a file called msgstore.something, however it had just 6MB. Way to small to contain all chats including all media.

So I was thinking, is there some way to pull a backup using for example adb or another feature of whatsapp or Android, or is all this data lost? Also can I assume the problem to be solved once I reset the phone or can I expect the error to persist?",,1,1.0

second of all, double tap zoom was one of my most used features in earlier android. u double tap the screen (WITH ONE HAND), then slide (WITH ONE HAND) and u can zoom (FREELY, WITH ONE HAND).

how

do i get that back. 

triple tap is stupid to me. i never wanna triple tap the screen. the current gestures for double tap r useless to me. 

magnifier is awful. u triple tap with one hand and its a suddenly-fixed zoom and i have tons of problems with it. 

i searched a ton for this, but its all old irrelevant posts or a ton of things on how to use the magnifier and i despise magnify or whatever. i *love* double tap & slide zoom and i used it *aaaalllll* the time. like constantly. how do i get that on android ten because its insanely frustrating.

also, if devs read this, u could have put double tap and slide into the settings as an option. ur google. that wouldnt be hard. no one at the offices was like ""hey, that was a good feature i used constantly?!""",,1,1.0

This post will help you to deal with this problem 


1. Download [App Inspector ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.projectoria.appinspector) app from playstore and locate the apps which you want to remove. Tap on it and you will see the package name of that app. Note down the package name somewhere on a paper. You will need it later on.

2. Download Platform tools and ADB Drivers of your phone on pc.
     i) :- [Plat form tools ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hBMnPhiaSXLDwpsJ2xgW3msevj2Dqpr/view?usp=drivesdk)

     ii) [Universal ADB Drivers ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dTgIS1Ys_uB0DmsTq27dvMaIKFaaepn/view?usp=drivesdk)

3. Enable USB Debugging on your phone. 

4. Connect your phone to your pc via a USB cable and locate ADB Driver folder which you downloaded earlier and run Universal ADB Driver app. It will automatically detect your phone. Now install USB Drivers. 

5. Now go to platform tools folder and open command prompt window here. 

6. Now enter the following commands and after each command press Enter. 
   i) adb devices 
   ii) adb shell
   iii) pm uninstall -k --user 0 name of package

Note :- replace ' name of package' with the package name which you have noted at the 1st step. 

7. By now you would have able to remove the system apps. 

8. If you still have some confusion you can watch my YouTube video on it. Hope this information helps you.

The G5 has no network issues. The G7 has chronic messaging issues. The only app we're using for messaging is the default Messages app from Google. MMS messages often take 5-15 minutes to send, or won't send at all until we turn off wifi. SMS messages sometimes won't send either. When I say they won't send, they say ""sending"" for a long time, then say it failed. Sometime the only way to send multiple SMS messages in a row is to restart the phone between each message. It is frustratingly erratic, so we haven't been able to isolate conditions that consistently replicate the problem, but it happens often.

Our carrier confirms that the settings are correct. The SIM card is pretty old and has some slight signs of wear, but they charge to replace it (ugh), so we haven't tried that yet. (If taking the phone off wifi sometimes fixes the problem, does that mean it's not the SIM card?) Moto is still updating Android for the G7, and the phone itself is fully updated. The phone was bought direct from Motorola and is out of warranty, so we'd have to go through their customer service if we decide it's the device.

* Install universal android drivers

    - Kill ADB Server...
    
    - Done =) -

# The second solution was using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). 

It failed to set force adoptable to true :

So i woke up the other day and went to check my phone like every morning, but this time the screen was black but the touch was working fine, anyways after checking with a repairman i was told that the screen needs to be changed and it's cheaper to get a new phone than repairing.

The problem is, I have a lot of stuff stored (photos, docs..etc) and I've been trying to extract em with not chance. connecting the phone with a pc needs a permission other options need usb debugging enabled, although I'm 100% sure it's debug enabled considering it's rooted, but the tools keep asking me to enable debug.

So.. a few days ago, my phone fell on the street and ever since then, it started flickering white whenever I access any app and it returns to normal randomly (or sometimes when I plug it in). Today however, it's completely white (with only, say, 20% of it being pure black on the top part) and it seems to me to be unresponsive to touch.

Is there some program I can use to backup some of the files? I tried a few such as Dr. Fone, but my phone's model isn't available within their options (mine's a Samsung S8) and PhoneRescue needs me to enable something called USB Debugging but I can't even unlock or see my phone.

Long story short, today out of nowhere my phone turned off and would not turn back on. After connecting to a charger the phone would start up but not boot to the main page. The boot cycle with the Samsung logo and Spring logo would just keep repeating. I removed the SIM card and the phone worked fine again, except for phone features obviously. When i reinserted the SIM card, however, the phone would turn off a few seconds later and would not restart unless I remove the SIM card and connect the phone to the charger first. 

I went to Sprint to replace the SIM card. Issue remains. They said its likely a battery issue, but they dont repair that phone there for some reason. The Sprint rep on the phone also believes its a battery issue as well. 

The only thing that happen today of note is that i was in an area with spotty service and i used 2 apps that i had not used in quite sometime.

I tried so far without any changes in symptoms or results:

* formatting the card in the phone, using the built-in wizard when inserting a new blank card
* rebooting the device (in the last few days more than in the last few years...)
* changing the file system on the new and old card from exFAT to FAT32 and vice versa
* manually pointing some of the apps (where possible) to `/storage/emulated/0` or the older/deprecated `/storage/nnnn-nnnn/` paths

All cards are working, tested in card reader on Linux and Windows, also the SD card is visible (r/w) if I connect the phone via USB to a PC.

749,Google Play Store constantly crashing,gz2cqm,2020-06-08 16:18:10,"I have a Samsung Tab S6 tablet (wifi only). Shortly after the last system update, Google Play Store started crashing. In the foreground, it crashes a few seconds after launch. If it runs in the background, I get a notice that it crashed every couple minutes.  I'm assuming some process wakes it in the background and it crashes in a similar time, since I don't see any apps updating.   I have to disable the app to use the tablet without constant crash notifications.  I mostly use it for reading, so this hasn't been too much of an inconvenience, but the apps area starting to get badly out of date.

So far I have tried

* Logging out of my Google Account and back in,
* Clearing app data.
* Resetting the app to factory and trying to let it update itself (still crashes)
* Sideloading the most recent version of the app from another device (still crashes)
* A virus scan on the device
* Samsung's built in log dump tools. I found the logs, but couldn't find any error messages relating to the crashes, though there's a lot of data there.

Anyone else experiencing this? Any pointers as to where I should look in the logs? I've got the Android dev environment installed on my desktop, though I mostly use it as a device simulator. Is there a live debugging tool that would help me narrow down the problem? I'm assuming it has something to do with updating an app, but that's just a guess.

My only other thought is a factory reset, and, ugh. And that's assuming that the user data backup wouldn't just cause the problem to reoccur.

750,Why no 1440p option showing on YouTube on tablet with a 2560x1600 display. It used to a year back.,gz2b6w,2020-06-08 16:15:51,"I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition model number SM-P600.

I have a Oneplus 5T, it runs LineageOS 16.0 (latest update) which is based on Android Pie. I run Nova as my launcher.

My problem: Very often when switching apps I get a blank screen, meaning the app I was switching to is not showing anything.

This happens either by using the ""Recent Apps"" switcher or by tapping a notification. And it mostly happens when I switch from a 3D App (games like PoGo, Ingress and similar) to a 2D app (like Telegram or even the phone app when a call is incoming).  Infact, the most often occurence of this is me being in PoGo, getting a Telegram notification, tapping it, boom, blank screen. 

Sometimes I can fix it by force closing f.e. telegram and restarting it, but often the ""Recent Apps"" view which I use to force close apps starts showing a blank screen to, so I have to reboot.

* my phone to automatically start charging when I plug in a USB cable *while simultaneously* giving me a USB Connection notification where I can switch it from charging to File Transfer.

More often than not, it won't start charging and it won't give me a notification, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get to the USB Connection Settings by browsing through the settings menus. 

I'll have to turn off the phone and then it will charge fine, meaning there's no lint in the USB port causing connection issues. 

Sometimes it does give me a hidden notification when I pull down to check for it, and quite often when I click it, it is set to USB Controlled by Connected Device, instead of by the phone. When I try to switch it to phone, it'll switch for a few seconds before switching back to Connected Device. Even when I do get it to stick on either option, the actual USB option menu below it is [greyed out](https://imgur.com/ELVmIYi)

Sometimes it will toggle between the two, sounding the charging notification beep every 5 seconds or so.

I've been pulling my hair out for a while now, and I've found several threads online where tons of people have very similar issues accross all types of devices, including high-end Pixels and Samsung phones.

I am at my wit's end, so I decided to factory reset my phone. Before doing so I wanted to export my pics and files ( *is this really needed? What will be gone after a factory reset? Apps, login info, account info?* ) 
But guess what, I still haven't been able to get my Mac to recognize the phone and have been unable to transfer anything.

I've also enabled developer options and tried switching the USB DEFAULT options there, to no avail. I must have rebooted my phone like twelve times this morning.

Note, these issues started a few weeks ago, before then I never had any of these issues.

Am I wrong to think that charging the phone and transferring files should be very basic functions of a mobile phone and should just work **consistently** without having to enable a secret developer options menu while getting utterly frustrated? Google doesn't seem to have an answer from what I can tell. What gives?

I looked at XDA and noticed that people do have the device rooted, but there is just a test build of Android 9.0 and that is about it. Is there any benefit to rooting if I'm not going to run a custom firmware?

What I've done so far that seems to have had a positive effect on performance:

* Disabled all but the essential notifications
* Turned off location services
* Disabled ""Find My Mobile""
* Turned on ""Reduce animations""
* Turned on ""rotation lock""
* Set power mode to ""Optimized"" (the other two options were Medium and Maximum power saving)

So I'm looking for something that i can't manage to find. Maybe it doesn't exist or isn't possible. My real goal it's just to play games in my bed, so i want mirror my pc screen on my phone. I know their is a tone of apps that can do that BUT they all require the pc and the phone to be on the same network, something i can't do because i'm in a university accommodation where i can't connect my phone and my pc to the same network.   
So i know Wifi-Direct exist, and from what I understand it doesn't need the two devices to be on the same network, i mean that's one of its advantages so... But i only can find app that require both devices to be on the same network. Also it's seems that is possible to mirror an Android screen to a pc (using true wifi-direct) but i can't find the opposite.  
So this is where I am, if anyone knows an app that can you REAL Wifi-Direct for mirroring my PC screen to my phone it would be great ! And if you don't, do you think its possible to achieve something like this ? If it's not feel free to explain me why, i am curious about.

Edit : So tried spacedesk and chrome remote access. Spacedesk kinda a require both devices to be on the same network, but making a WiFi hotspot with my phone and connecting to it on my pc make the thing work, but yeah with some good lag. But still great for anything else but gaming. Chrome Remote Access is very simple, weirdly a little less lag but still no usable.

However, the device is getting older and I have been fine with using it for as long as I can.

Recently (about two to three months ago) I began having issues with the charging port until it eventually failed entirely.

I never really had to deal with phone repairs. The local tech guy I trust doesn't do phones so he referred me to Staples. 

Staples didn't repair it on site, so I had to wait a week and a half without a phone while they fixed it. They also made me sign something releasing them from liability from any damage to the phone.

In the end, when I got it back, the new charging port seemed to be working fine and I assumed I'd be able to keep the phone for another year or two before worrying about having to get something new. 

Yesterday I noticed my phone was again having issues with the charging port. It hasn't failed completely, but it keeps telling me it's not getting enough charge and giving full charge estimates of 25 hours. It charges wirelessly just fine.

Honestly I don't want to deal with Staples again. My expectation is that they will offer to repair it again, but I don't want to deal with another week and a half of waiting, only to possibly have to deal with yet another faulty charging pin. I use my phone too much to be comfortable with wireless charging only. Even though I use it a lot, it took quite awhile before I had an issue with the pin. I have no reason to believe that the latest pin issue is my fault.

But now I don't know what to do... ***should I find a better repair place to bring it to? Or should I just set up the phone as mobile device for my son to use and just replace the phone outright?*** I don't really enjoy having to replace the phone as I am someone who benefits from having a phone of a high quality, but that comes with a commensurate price increase that makes it difficult to afford them outright, but that's my best option when it comes to purchasing phones at the moment.

How risky is it actually to have an unsupported phone? 

If you read the latest android security bulletin

https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2020-06-01

It states: 

""The severity assessment is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service mitigations are turned off for development purposes or if successfully bypassed."" 

Does this mean that vanilla users that lock their phones, are educated about phishing and only install apps from google play store are anyways not affected by these threats? 

Or should unsupported android users be weary of using sensitive apps such as mobile banking, because it may be a matter of time until something goes wrong.",,0,0.5

I recently started using adoptable storage and it has been working amazingly and solved the space issues I had perfectly. However, I now experience a super weird bug where in the phone's own storage settings, the system is shown as being 102GB in size. Both the PC when connected to the phone as well as my file manager show the phone with the ""correct"" filled SD card of \~42GB. I'm pretty sure this is a visual bug, does anyone know how to make the device settings show the correct value as well? It's not really annoying, but if it can be fixed I would do it.

(I'm on a Xiaomi Redmi Note 4x with Android 7.0, SD card is a 128 GB San Disk Extreme SDXC)

892,An update to a previous question about 'MMS not being sent to some contacts',gxt14k,2020-06-06 15:30:40,"Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/gw5h0t/mms_not_being_sent_to_some_contacts/

So after some trial and error, I have figured out a common thread that photographs (picture files that were created with my phone camera) are not being sent but other image files seem to pass unencumbered.  For example, if I take a screenshot of my phone screen or send a meme downloaded from reddit, the MMS seems to go through to any contact.  However, if I take a picture of my dinner and try to send it to my contacts, it seems to not go through.  It does not seem to matter if the picture is captured through the text messaging app or my camera app and then uploaded to the Text Messenger app.


Text-based MMS's do not seem unencumbered.

Because of this I think it might be a carrier problem?  I'm not sure though because there should not be a difference between a camera image file and an image file downloaded from the internet.


Running Android 9 and using the Messages app.  I did try some alternative Texting apps no difference (and that also leads me to believe it;s a carrier thing or a more fundamental issue with android 9)",,1,0.6

I just picked up the Black Shark 3 after being generally disappointed for most of a year with the Razer Phone 2. I got the EU version (I guess?) and have been having general issues with the wireless.

Periodically, almost the entire suite of wireless connectivity just drops. My WearOS watch (Ticwatch Pro 2020) will disconnect, and the custom watchface I use via Watchfaces disappears. Wifi usually keeps working so I may not notice the drop right away, but if I'm on my phone's cellular connection, nothing goes through even though it shows signal and LTE. In my car on my way home from work this morning I was on the phone with my captain, and the bluetooth connection to my car started cutting in and out, to the point that I had to turn bluetooth off to finish the call. There was no issue up to that point, while driving and listening to Audible.

I am suspecting/hoping it was user error in setting the device up. I backed up my RP2 to Google Drive, because I didn't want to lose my apps/data (I was mostly hoping my Swype settings and game logins would transfer over, since Swype died and I'm being a luddite, and the games require the hassle of 'transfer IDs') and have my text messages transfer over easily. I think it also possibly transferred the core device stuff like cellular and bluetooth settings as well, though am not sure.

Turning airplane mode on and off seems to 'reset' things and it'll reconnect to stuff, for a while again at least. I noticed I am somehow still getting at least some push notifications on my watch even though it shows as disconnected. I am a firefighter, on AT&T's Firstnet, so am also not sure if maybe the Firstnet bands might be being finnicky with the BS3.

I also get the ""Xiaomi SIM activation failed"" alert every time I restart the phone, and sometimes after reboot the keyboard doesn't load. 😬 I get the feeling ill need to reflash again, but knowing where I went wrong first would help! Also curious if there is a stock Android ROM because this JoyUI seems a hassle, and I just don't want all the Xiaomi stuff.

For the past 3 months my cell service has been getting glitchier and glitcher until yesterday when my cell service stopped returning at all.  I have ATT and know where I isually have service, and my family uses ATT too and their service is fine.

 I first noticed the weekend the COVID stuff started getting big, and thought it was just related service interruptions, but weeks went by and didnt improve. I started noticing that my cell service cut out every time I was charging my phone, and the past week or so noticed that the back of my phone would get really warm whenever the cell service cut out. Initially it would work again when I restarted my phone, at least for a few minutes, then the minutes became seconds,  and now there is nothing.  I also noticed that my battery was draining much faster than normal and my phone was even warmer.

I thought I had a bad SIM card, so I swapped it with some family members SIM cards from their iphones.  My card worked fine in their phones, but my phone still had no service with their cards.
I put my sim card in my 9 year old Pantech slide-out-keyboard phone (Almost made me wish we still used them, ha) and the pantech is working fine, making calls and all that.  Without the SIM card, my android's battery was draining normally again, and then later I noticed that it showed full cell signal bars. I was unable to make calls because it did t have a SIM card of course, but Im guessing I had full signal strength for any emergency calls?

Anyways,  is this probably a hardware issue and I just need a new phone? Or some error/glitch somewhere that I can fix? Ive factory reset my phone to no avail, as well as had ATT reset my connection from their end.

Pixel 2 on Verizon, 2.5 years old, running Android 10, last security update 6/5. 


I tried the following: soft resets, virus scan, malware scan, deleting unused apps, booting in safe mode, removing the case, and a factory reset. 


The scans found nothing. Deleting apps didn't help. Safe mode was inconclusive since I can't find a reliable way to replicate the problems. Factory reset only got rid of about 25% of the problems. However, these ones actually got worse: tapping and scrolling issues, and dropped or delayed network (internet) signal.

My phone runs on the same network as 2 other phones in the household. All 3 phones and the TV have the same wifi problems, but none have network issues. The nearest tower is 0.9 miles away. This was never a problem over a month ago. I use wifi about 50% of the time, and have the same bugs.

If I try to utilize any adb commands it doesn't recognize the device.

958,Rooting a Cubot King Kong 3 - a few general questions,gwz0te,2020-06-05 06:08:51," Hello,

I'm interested in rooting a Cubot King Kong 3 phone (MT 6763 phone), which features Oreo 8.1.

For   my general understanding, I have a few questions and I really that   somebody is so kind to help me shed some light on the following:

1. Is   it possible to root any random phone just by unlocking the bootloader   with ADB, flashing TWRP and then installing SuperSU in the recovery?

Is   this the general approach I can use also on the Cubot King Kong 3? Or   do I need a TWRP which is modified / customized for this phone? I would   like to clarify this, before I do something and brick the phone.

2.   What are some safety measures to take, before trying to root, so that I   can reinstate the phone to the original state, if something goes  wrong?

3.  Do I have to disable  any kind of data partition encryption so that I  can root the phone? Or  can I still root the phone without doing this?

4.   What is a scatter file and for what is it used? I've read a lot of   guides and it seems to be used only with SPFlash. Does this mean, that I   do not need this, if root by going the ADB+TWRP+SuperSU route?

5. If after unlocking the bootloader with fastboot, I am getting the message  ""*Orange State Your devices has been unlocked* and *can't* be *trusted*. "" at boot, then what went wrong and can this be fixed?

6.   If after flashing the stock ROM, which Cubot provides on their forum, I   get a red text ""Not Verify"" in the upper right corner of the screen   every time the phone is on, then what went wrong and can this be fixed?

970,Question about passwords and how apps handle them.,gwu0bl,2020-06-05 00:31:36,"So I've been downloading a bunch of apps lately, lots of which require you to log in. Problem is, some of these apps, which are actually apps from large legitimate companies, when I type my password in, gboard will show the password at the top in the autocomplete suggestions in plain view as I type it for the first time. It then remembers my password, and whenever I type the first 2 or 3 letters, the password appears again for me to tap to auto fill it in. I could be typing anywhere, in any app, on any website, even in this reddit text box im typing in now, and if a word matches the first 2 or 3 letters, gboard shows my password again, plainly visible to anyone that can see my screen. As gboard is treating it as a normal learned word rather than a password, it's probably also storing it in plain text somewhere, rather than encrypting it like a password should be, and possibly exposing it to other apps. 

So, correct me if I'm wrong, but the developers of the apps that I'm typing my password in to (not the gboard app) should somehow be preventing this, right? Are they not properly coding their password box as a password or something? I could have sworn that other apps are somehow temporarily able to disable gboard's autocomplete while I'm typing a password.

First I thought it was the headphones then I bought 3 new headphones to replace them and for backups - I bought new headphones and tried them all and they all had the same static in the right headphone - the static is low and gives off a buzz feeling as in you can slightly feel the static of it as well like a very light vibration - when I click pause to pause audio the headphone audio pauses and the static carries on buzzing for a second then cuts off where you can hear the cut off and then the static stops - then press play and the static starts again with the audio - so when the audio is paused the electric stops going through it and stops causing the buzz.

So I bought a few 3.5mm male to female jacks to try out and found when the 4th pole that controls the mic and play/pause button is not plugged in the sound is perfect with no static but then you lose play/pause functionality and also this is not practical/sustainable to use with the last pole balancing in the port - then I tried old type 3 pole headphones into the 3.5mm jacks and they work perfect with no static but also no play/pause functionality on those type of headphones - also tried headset type (over-head type) headphones and they worked with no static.

So I have narrowed it down to the problem being the 4th pole that controls mic and play/pause functionality - I also tried the headphones in other devices and they work normal so it is definitely the phone that has had some type of damage that now causes static through the headphones.

Now I am going to disassemble the phone to see if anything is touching the headphone port or something I don't know what is wrong with it or what I should do though so does anybody know where to start.

Thanks.

980,"Half the time when I put my phone in its caddy after turning off the screen, it wakes itself up. Why?",gwqln6,2020-06-04 21:24:51,"Moto G7

Android v9

No, I am not pressing a button while dropping it in the caddy.

I turn off the screen either by pressing the power button or an onscreen button I created in KLWP, but roughly 50% of the time when I set it in its caddy, the screen immediately turns on as if I had pressed the fingerprint reader or the power button. I have seen it happen when I was being especially careful to not touch either area as I placed the phone in the caddy.

I know there's a feature where if you look at the screen it will stay active, or at least I remember reading about it, but none of the cameras are pointed at me while it's in the caddy. The phone sits at an approximate 45 degree angle and the cameras are pointed at a drink coaster and a ceiling.

Any ideas what's going on here? Thank you in advance.",,1,1.0

And I don't know if this is the right place to ask stuff like this, but, I need help the most right now.

So, I downloaded multiple games from a site. These were not games that you can find in a playstore, the size for each app was above 500mb.

So I downloaded it via MEGA, some Installed successfully and others don't. Since I finished playing them all and deleted it, my Internal Storage was more than it used to be (like way more, it's like i didn't even deleted those file). 

I was using about 22GB of storage before, but now it is at 29.5GB out of 32GB. 

How can I clean these files that i cannot find? Any tips and help from you smart people will help my stupidity in tech :)

And yes I do clean my cache manually and regularly.
Again any help would be appreciated, if there are some crucial information missing I apologize. (again I am not that bright at tech stuff)

Please tell we if there are some missing details.
and please use some light words for explaining or elaborate more.",,26,0.94
984,Playback pausing issue with stock music player,gwpkuf,2020-06-04 20:32:42,"So on my old phone a few months ago I noticed that my music from the phones stock music app would randomly stop or pause at the end of a song, and would start up again with the next song by hitting play. I figured the phone was just old and low on RAM and storage.

I now have a brand new LG v60 and the problem persists. I notice it on my Bluetooth speaker, Bluetooth car radio and even on my headphones which are wired. Obviously there is no issue with this phones RAM or storage. 

I've scoured the web for answers but keep coming up with the same ""solutions"" that don't apply, so I thought i would ask here.

Again, its totally random. Sometimes more frequent and others less so. And it only happens between songs. So a song will finish, but the next won't start until I press play again.

I only use my phones music player, I don't stream. So the songs are on the phone itself, and not on an SD card.

Any input would be greatly appreciated!",,1,1.0
