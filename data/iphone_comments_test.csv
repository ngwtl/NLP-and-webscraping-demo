Many people don’t realize that pocket fuzz gets compressed and impacted in the bottom of the port over time, causing the lighting cable to not seat fully into the port and the pins don’t make proper contact. I’d estimate 80% of the people coming into my shop with charging issues just need the port cleaned out. 

If the plastic part of the lightning cable is not flush with the phone housing when inserted, there is crap in the port. Another way to tell is if you can’t dangle the phone upside down by the charging cable. There are two spring latches that should click into the side groves of the lighting connector, these will allow your phone to hang upside down by the cord when they are in latched in properly. if they aren’t latched and your phone comes unplugged when dangling from the cord upside down, you have crap in the bottom of the port. I use a needle bent with a slight L shape at the tip to clean out hard packed stuff from iphone lightning ports. Just be super careful to not touch or hook the pins down inside the port. You can also use a plastic or wooden toothpick to be more safe, but I do this on a daily basis and personally prefer to use a sharp, rigid metal tool for hard packed stuff in the port, but just being cautious of where I’m scraping.",,1

If the phone is dead, your carrier can give you your imei or it may even be printed on the edge of the sim tray.

As for your battery almost being dead, most 3rd party shops can recharge your battery enough to get up and runningmfor data recovery. I also even have gone as far to connect a new charging port to the logic board long enough to just sync data to iTunes or for people to recover photos on devices that they don’t want to pay for a full repair. I install charge ports on 7 and 8 series iPhones for $70 in my shop, it’s definitely reasonable to repair a charge port in most 3rd party repair shops.",,2

If so, did you put your Tmo SIM or did it have a Tmo SIM in the tray when you started the setup upon opening the box? If this is the case, the iPhone was provisioned to Tmo and it's now locked.",,2
170,he3r82,"Yeah, I did not purchase it at the apple store. I put I n the t mobile sim to set up the phone because i saw online that updating the phone could fix the problem.

So I guess now I locked the phone to t mobile and need to call them to unlock it?",,1

BUT....Even IF the backup point you’re restoring from had the app not offloaded it’s likely it may not open or work. 

The app would still need to talk to the app developer to work..if it’s been removed it’s likely there’s no server to talk to and your app will just crash.

Regardless if it’s backed up or not. 

iCloud Keychain or 1 Password and many other password managers are the next steps.",,1

I have an older MacBook Pro that’s running OS X 10.9.5, which means I also have an older version of iTunes that still has the app manager. Miraculously, all I had to do was plug in my dad’s phone to my laptop, then press “Install App” from the app manager! Somehow, all of the passwords were still there! We’re fairly confident he has most or all of his passwords since he has more entries on his phone than on his desktop app that I mentioned.",,2

206,hdwdkq,"The 6S has 2 connectors for the home button. Be careful if you try to reseat them, the flex cable is delicate! The metal plate that holds the button from behind can be taken off with a couple small Phillips screws and you’ll see the first connector, then that flex cable runs up through the screen assembly and connects into the connector at the top of the screen and into logic board connector under the removable metal plate at the top of the logic board held by 4-5 more little Phillips screws.. It’s possible there is a loose connection, but not common for them to loosen because they are held by metal plates at both top and bottom. But f the screen was removed for a cam repair, it’s possible. Also as stated by someone else, you can’t just repair the fingerprint function on any iPhone, as it’s an encrypted chip matched to your logic board that only the Apple Store can replace or re-program.",,1

Actually...try restoring (not updating) the device and see how that goes. It will erase the entire device and remove the passcode. If it is still associated with an AppleID, around screen 5 it should prompt for a password and say “Activation Lock” at the top of the screen. If it doesn’t, then it should be good.

Charging, including wireless charging, slows or stops.
The display dims or goes black.

I closed any apps I had in the background and let it sit by itself for a while with the brightness down (that I dimmed myself, not the phone) and it looks like it's back to normal. If it does happen again I'll restart the phone like you suggested.

Try getting your iPhone into DFU mode and proceed as normal with restore when connected to iTunes.

* Top tip for DFU, you DO-NOT want the Apple Logo/iTunes logo showing when it’s connected to your Mac when you follow the steps..

but you DO want your Mac to recognise something is connected when the screen is black. Then proceed as normal as if it’s a restore.

One way you can check on the device to know if you might run into the same problem in the very near future, once it’s up and running again go to > Settings > Privacy > Analytics & Improvements > Analytics Data and check for anything that relates to “full-panic” or “kernel-panic”.

If you don’t see anything like that...your probably in the clear. If you do, it’s likely the issue is hardware and it’s time to look at replacement options I’m afraid.

Not 100% tho 

Check the Apple store",,1

Ask the one who set up his phone, if he/she can remember any email and password from the setup.

544,hc225x,Saddly the warranty it has doesn't cover me being an idiot and dropping the phone :D. But I'm gonna take it apples support on monday so they can run diagnostics and try to get to the bottom of the issue. Hopefully it doesn't require extensive fixes.,,1
545,hc225x,Could it be that when you scroll a certain distance you happen to touch a certain part of the screen? What happens if you try and interact while it does that? does it try to do multi finger gestures like zooming and stuff,,1
546,hc225x,It will. So let me explain. Since I fix iPhones. You don’t need to say anything just say it started to do that and see what they say. If they are going to charge you it will be either a full replacement free or charge of what ever that so and so model is so if it’s 329 then that’s what it will be. Or they may charge you for a new screen as that’s what it is in my opinion a new screen will fix it,,1

My ipod was stolen too and I hadn't backed up its data also. However I didn't learn anything from that experience 🤦‍♂️ I couldn't care less at that time.

605,hbljtj,But im out of warranty. Plus ive seen in macforums some users are having the same problems. Green tint appears on the screen randomly but doesnt affect the performance of the phone at all,,1
606,hbljtj,It could just be due to a defect that has resulted in this problem after having the phone for a while.,,3
607,hbljtj,I would still contact apple and explain your situation. If your lucky they might be willing to swap it. When you contact make sure to be adamant that the device has suffered no damage and it is clearly a issue with the supplied display.,,1
608,hbljtj,My screen works fine though. Nothing is wrong with it even my touch screen. If the green line disappears it still work amazingly. Sadly i know that there is still a problem with my phone.,,1

&nbsp;

If there is a wired (or wireless) connection between your phone and the camera, and the video is still stored locally on your dash cam, it’s conceivable that’s how the video reappears.

&nbsp;

In addition, if there is a cloud service to which your cam connects, such as Dropbox, it may have read/write access to your photos on iOS. I am unsure if cloud services (other than iCloud) currently have the ability to push photos and videos to your iOS Photos Camera Roll, but it’s worth mentioning.",,1
620,hbdsor,It’s turned off and I even cleared iCloud of everything except contacts.,,2
621,hbdsor,I used a memory card adapter to plug the memory card into my phone. Then used the “files” app to download the video to my Photos app.,,2
622,hbdsor,"Doesn’t sound like that would be the culprit, then. If you turned off all the iCloud syncing options except for contacts as you stated, including iCloud Drive, it’s possible the video gets transferred back if you sync your phone to iTunes or the Mac Photos app via cable or Wi-Fi somehow. That assumes the video is on your other device and it detects the video is “missing” on your phone, resulting in its restoration.

&nbsp;

Apple Support could probably help you if none of that seems likely, since they’re the experts. You can call them on the phone or use a form on the Apple website and someone will email you back with a reply. For this, I’d suggest a phone call.",,1

637,hb59pq,An iCloud backup on my iPhone but its only 5GBs.,,1
638,hb59pq,"5Gb should be enough for a normal backup, so long as you don’t enable things like photos.

I make encrypted backups using a Mac, and have actually had people who didn’t realise they had new hardware... until they went to use headphones (they discovered I’d given them lightning headphones to replace their 3.5mm ones)",,1

640,hb3qz1,"Fold a paper towel up into a little square pad. Soak it with water and then squeeze most of the water out but allow some to remain inside. Maybe squeeze out 75% of the water.

With the iPhone oriented sideways so that the side button is on top, press the button repeatedly through the paper towel while allowing water to squeeze out to wash out the button area. This should be far safer than just putting the button under running water or putting the button just barely under standing water and pressing it.

iPhone 7 is the first iPhone to have water resistance, so this should be safe. However, it's your choice whether you do this, so if any water damage occurs, I will not be held responsible. I'm just telling you what you can do because I believe there's no other way unless you want to take it to an Apple store and have them clean it. That could be expensive.

I have iPhone 11 and I did this successfully. I accidentally got a little lemonade splashed onto my side button which later resulted in the clicky feeling being completely eliminated. After doing what I described above, it feels and operates just like new and it has felt and operated just like new ever since.

733,habga4,"> I did call my provider to block the device but I forgot to ask if the data within will still be accessible.

Welp, this may have wrecked your chances for deleting your data.

[Try going here](https://www.icloud.com/find). Login with your Apple ID, and see if the site can track the location of your phone.  If you're lucky, you might even be able to find out where it is and recover it!

Unfortunately, this requires that your phone be on and have a data connection. If you called your provider and had them block the phone, then it's no longer on the cellular network and won't get data that way.. Only if the phone has auto-connected to WiFi (or the person taking it has connected to a WiFi network or inserted a new SIM) will it show up here.

That site also gives you the option to wipe your phone remotely, but this also requires an active network connection.  Note that if you wipe the data from your phone remotely, you will no longer be able to track its location.

Next time you lose your phone, follow steps in this order:

* Login, track your phone, lock it down with a passcode and a ""contact me"" message
* If you can't locate or physically recover it, *then* do a remote data wipe
* *Then* contact your provider to block the device.

Note: If you had a passcode on your iPhone, then the data on it is encrypted. Whoever has your phone would need the passcode to unlock your device and get data off it.",,2

786,ha06dz,"How old is the phone? Has it suffered any drops or water damage?

It is more likely that the battery needs to be replaced.

There is a PC application called 3utools which you can use to see how many cycles the battery has been through. iPhone batteries last about 500 cycles (One charge cycle is the battery discharge from 100% to 0%), so if your phone is showing 400+ cycles, then it is worth considering replacing the battery. 

FYI - If you discharge the battery to 50% and charge it up. Discharge it to 50% and charge it up, then that is one charge cycle.

As the battery ages from time and discharge cycles, it will become less efficient. By about 500 cycles, the battery would show approximately 80% capacity. For example - a new iPhone 6 capacity is 1810mAh, after 500 cycles, it would have about 1448mAh (80%). This will show up as ""100%"".

However, this may not diagnose any other faults or issues with the device.",,4

Did you try turning the volume up while on the call?
Does this happen only on phone calls? Do you have the same behavior during FaceTime audio calls or Facebook Messenger audio calls?

Deeper stuff check:

Are you up to date with iOS 13.5.1? Have you tried restarting your iPhone?

Are your other notification sounds playing normally?

Is the sound issue only while your iPhone is directly against your head? If you pull your iPhone away from your head (to the point the display comes back on) does the volume increase?

Turn off Attention Aware. Attention Aware will adjust volumes based on if the iPhone detects if you are actively using it or not. It should only adjust ringer and notification volumes, but it may be interfering with your call volume as well.

When you set up your new iPhone, select the “Restore from iCloud Backup” option and you’ll see a list of backups made in the past couple of weeks, with their respective dates listed as well. You can also see when your last automatic backup was on another iOS device if you are signed into the same iCloud account as your old phone was.

Green means it thinks B is a non iPhone. If blue it knows it’s a iPhone. I phones don’t send SMS to another iPhones anymore they use MMS encryption service. It sends SMS to a non iPhone and it displays a green bubble. Maybe it’s that. Try to delete both contacts on both phones and create new contacts and try again. 

Go to settings. Go to messages on both phones and make sure the iMessage is on.  Turn on the sms also if iMessages isn’t available at any time. iPhones will try to send it in MMS but will eventually send it in SMS if needed to.

969,h82951,"Rice really does nothing, it does not pull the moisture away from your device. As soon as you've got water in it the damage is done- corrosion is a chemical reaction and starts immediately.

The reason it has become a myth is because people leave their devices in rice for a few days and suddenly it works again, when the reality is simply that the water has evaporated from the internals.

As above once a device is water damaged, it will never be the same again. It might work for a few days, few months, a year etc. but it will always fail at some point due to the water.

1113,h0ulf2,"Personally, I bought a waterproof Bluetooth speaker that hangs on my shower rack, that way I don’t have to risk my $1000 iPhone X in the shower. That would be my first recommendation. 

If you are going to have it with you in the shower I wouldn’t recommend putting it directly in the stream of water, it’s “resistant” not “water proof.” If you have a shelf where it might get splashed, that’s safer, but you still want to try to avoid contact with water. 

On [Apple’s website about water resistance](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207043) it says the following. 

To prevent liquid damage, avoid these:
-	Swimming or bathing with your iPhone
-	Exposing your iPhone to pressurized water or high velocity water, such as when showering, water skiing, wake boarding, surfing, jet skiing, and so on

So like I said, maybe if you have a place where it might accidentally get a little splash, like a shelf or something up high, you could try that. But I would really recommend a waterproof Bluetooth speaker, they aren’t expensive, seen them for $40 and they sound better than iPhone speakers.",,1
1114,h0ulf2,Buy either waterproof case or bluetooth speaker waterproof. Bluetooth speaker better option as sound be louder.,,1
1115,h0ulf2,"I wouldn't bring it in touch with any liquid. It's only officially waterproof, and Apple doesn't apply their warranty to water damage. Many people had broken or damaged phones because they dropped their phone into the pool, the sink or because they used it in the shower. Don't.",,1
1116,h0ulf2,"One more vote for Bluetooth speaker. DO NOT take in to the shower with you. Steam is reasonably safe (but not for 4-5 hours ofc), but not the direct water impact. Don't join the army of idiots that decided to swim in the pool with an expensive piece of tech.

If you'll still decide to take a shower with the phone, better make an encrypted backup before this.",,1

&#x200B;

 (by now, others have already mentioned helium)

[https://www.ifixit.com/News/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium](https://www.ifixit.com/News/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium)",,2
1292,gz7352,"UPDATE: So 4 days since it died, I realized only yesterday how known the issues with Iphone 8 and helium were by googling ""Iphone 8 helium"", I saw the fixit article and even how Apples user guide says they don't go well together. So the link is definitely there, and it seems unnecessary for me to test my phone in a plastic bag since others have already done that and documented on youtube. 

Now it's not like I spray my phone with helium while we weld, and noone starts talking funny because of it but we operate in a 170m3 room, and during 8-12 hours we use up about 1½ 50l flask of helium pressurized to 200 bar. We seal the room as well as possible but we run the air in the room through a dehumidifier so I have no idea how much helium builds up. But it seems conceivable that with those conditions, enough of these little helium atoms could find their way into whatever part it is that makes this happen. 

I guess I can't be 100% sure this is the issue but it makes sense in a beautiful way, and it was really exciting to find about this. I read somewhere that Apple said to leave the phone to completely discharge for about a week before charging again should bring it back up, which matches our earlier experience. I guess in the future the best solution is to just not bring the phone to this workspace for this time. Which would be probably be the same solution as if I had concluded it would have been another aspect of this welding process that did the damage, but it still points to the gas.

Thanks for taking your time helping me out, it didn't cross my mind that it could be the gas before you guys brought it up.",,1

1294,gz7352,"Cool, thanks for your reply. It makes sense that weld -> EMF -> electronics acting up but it's just so specific that it keeps on happening here. We've used the same welding machines for other jobs but me and my colleagues haven't seen it happen anywhere but in Germany. That might just be a coincidence that we happen to be working here at the same time as we are being issued a phone that are sensitive to just whatever this machine does.

I googled deep discharge and that seems a bit scary, is it safe to me to leave the phone with charger plugged in while I sleep? Is there a solution to recover Iphones from this state or is it just not supposed to have it happening to them?",,3

Not all devices are made the same. It would make sense for this to be the cause, but not effect every device and location.

Try this. Triple bag your devices in zip lock bags (the helium will find its way in either way). See if it mitigates the occurrences to some degree",,2
1309,gz7352,"If you use helium, fat chance thats it. The symptoms match

Not sure how you could shield the phone from helium. I guess putting it in a baggie would help, but helium can actually propagate through the bag ever so slightly. But might be your best try to start with.

1388,gyds3d,Thank you! I thought I was going crazy.,,2
1389,gydkg2,"You've rubbed off the oleophobic coating on those parts of the screen, which helps protect the screen from smudges (it's how fingerprints rub off really easily when you wipe your screen).

Oleophobic coatings are supposed to last for years but I guess if you keep rubbing/pressing the same spots it'll rub off sooner.  
How long have you been gaming on it (as in, hour-wise)?

Apple will likely see it as normal wear and tear, so the above question is important (because gaming on it for less than a couple of hours per day shouldn't do this, and should therefore be covered under warranty).",,3
1390,gydkg2,[images](https://imgur.com/a/wtSlQKz),,1
1391,gydkg2,"I don't know but it is very well over a couple of hours a day. 

If I had to put a guess, cumulatively might've been over a hundred hours",,1
1392,gydkg2,"Apple will regard it as normal wear and tear unfortunately (the same as any other manufacturer).

You might be able to make it disappear by applying a tempered glass screen protector (a tempered glass one specifically, as it will better mask where the coating has rubbed off).",,2
1393,gydkg2,"yes I am planning to use a tempered glass but I was simply curious as to whether I can get rid of those patches before doing so.

however is there any way that one can do something by themselves? or is it not worth the risks associated with doing so",,1
1394,gydkg2,"Get some IPA (isopropyl alcohol- *don't* use any other alcohol such as ethanol) and rub the screen, you won't need to use much force and the coating will start to come off.

Do this for the entire screen and then apply the tempered glass screen protector. Use a microfibre cloth to remove any fingerprints or dust before applying it.",,2
1395,gydkg2,"so basically taking it all off to make it homogeneous, alright then.

also is there a way that after taking the entire thing off you can reapply an oleophobic coating evenly? 

which option would you go for actually, simply getting a tempered as it is rn or doing it after taking off the entire coating.",,1
1396,gydkg2,"I'd remove the coating and then apply the tempered glass. I've seen products that claim to effectively re-apply the coating but have never seen one do what it says on the tin (aka, they don't work properly).

Search Google for ""macbook staingate remove coating"" for a step-by-step guide on removing it (the same problem of a coating coming off, but not the same root cause- will still apply here though).",,3
1397,gydkg2,thanks a lot :),,1
1398,gydkg2,"They work properly if you use them as directed. I am speaking from experience with the Crystal Armor Fusso oleophobic coating. Applying it properly requires patience and time, but it works as long as you do it correctly. One bottle is about $15 and it is enough for 1 ***full*** application. That's why it's a tiny bottle.

Now, here is how you use it (all of these steps are actually pretty easy to perform, and they all count as 1 full application):

1. Apply 10-15 drops evenly over the glass. Don't try to be perfect, you won't be able to do it perfectly.
2. Before it evaporates, spread it evenly to cover 100% of the glass using something that doesn't absorb liquid. I used a squeegee. **DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED BLACK MICROFIBER CLOTH**. That's just a free gift included with your purchase to help you with your daily cleaning of the glass.
3. Using a facial tissue or a paper towel, simultaneously rub it in and wipe it off.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 above 3 more times for a total of 5 mini applications (not to be confused with a full application)
5. Repeat steps 1-**2** above just 1 time.
6. Let the evenly-spread oleophobic coating product sit untouched for 8 or more hours. This is the curing process. This is the critical stage most people don't have the patience for and it's why they say it doesn't work. Thanks to Voice Control, you can still use the iPhone without touching it. So set it up before you do all of this. Don't be fooled into thinking just an hour or two is good enough. 8 or more hours. The longer the better. That's just how this stuff works.
7. After the 8+ hours of curing time, wipe off the excess until the glass *looks* clean. Use a facial tissue or a paper towel or a clean cotton cloth that you're willing to put into the laundry basket after because this stuff is a little bit oily. Don't touch the glass while you're doing this, or after.
8. Now use a wet paper towel or a wet cotton cloth (not dripping wet, just wet enough to clean the glass) and clean off the remaining oily residue that I guarantee you cannot see but it's there. So again, I advise try to avoid touching the display glass until you've completed this step, otherwise it'll be on your skin. It's a subtle oily residue. I'm sure you don't want to accidentally get it in your mouth or your eyes or transferred to some of your belongings.

After step #8 above, you will have completed the 1st of 5 full applications. Do this for 5 days in a row, and I guarantee you the glass will feel just like new for the next 6-8 months, just like Apple's oleophobic coating. Again, I'm speaking from experience.

Edit: After 1-2 or even 3 full applications, you'll believe you've done enough applications because it will feel brand-new again, but don't be fooled. Make sure you do all 5 full applications.",,3
1399,gy96g4,"Provide proof of purchase to Apple, where:

* Shows the device sold as new.
* Shows the seller's information where they are established as a business.
* The purchase date roughly aligns with the date the device was activated on (only Apple can see this, should be within a month or so of the purchase date).

If the proof of purchase has all the above, Apple should be able to validate you as the owner and be able to remove the remote management lockout.

  
Not sure how Apple's remote management works, but it might work by simply entering the serial number into the system- if so it's reasonable to assume the company it's now locked to entered one of the serial numbers incorrectly.",,5

1405,gy96g4,"This is what I’ve done when helping people in the past.

If the eBay seller can provide proof that it was a new device, Apple may be able to remove the MDM, depending on the type of MDM it’s enrolled in.",,3
1406,gy96g4,[removed],,1
1407,gy96g4,"You opting to try and offend me says otherwise. MDM is a service offered by Apple for private companies via its Enterprise scheme, unlocking a device from MDM is not a legal issue if you are the legal owner of the device.

It was simply a suggestion, and I never said it would 100% work. 

However if Apple refuses to remove MDM with proof of purchase, the company who locked the device refusing to remove MDM, and the seller refuses to refund, I see no alternative but to take both that company and the seller to small claims (assuming the OP _really wanted_ their device back working properly). 

I’d imagine the initiation of a small claims against them would be enough to get them to remove it, and even if not you have documentation that verify beyond doubt that it is your device. 

MDM is monitoring software, not sure what the laws are over in the US but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was highly illegal to place spying software on someone’s device without their permission (or being a law enforcement agency).",,2
1408,gy96g4,I’m pretty sure MDM can’t be removed by Apple. The serial number is essentially in that company’s database.,,2

Tried to update the iOS with a Mac. She doesn’t wanna restore the phone as she will lose the data. (Photos) so we only did the update not the restore option. 

Next thing is to try to use a program to fix it. But it cost 50 bucks. Doesn’t mean it will work.

1416,gy38s8,Yea. I know. She’s not tech savvy. Told her million times to back up. Restore and start fresh.  She never does it. Now she’s pissed that her stuff is locked up. Won’t restore it. Because she will lose it. So now it’s a paper weight.,,1

1421,gy35j4,What’s the battery health reading (sounds like it might be consumed),,2
1422,gy35j4,"This is why it's necessary to recalibrate the battery once every few months. Do it now. Here's how:

1. Allow the power to run out until iOS shuts down automatically
2. Plug it in and leave it plugged in until the iPhone finishes recharging to 100%. Don't unplug it until it's done. Note: it could take 1-2 hours for the iPhone to turn back on and start up after you plug it in. This doesn't happen when you regularly recalibrate the battery.
3. When it's finished charging to 100%, shut down the iPhone and unplug it.
4. Start the iPhone back up (so yeah, turn it back on)

Repeat this about 4-5 times. You can try to do it all in one day, or one time per day. It doesn't matter. 4-5 times will be necessary since this is likely the first time you've ever done it with this old iPhone.

After you're done with the 1st of 4-5 0-100% recharges, you will notice a big improvement to the battery level reading's accuracy and you might even get slightly more battery power before you have to recharge.

And yes, what is the Maximum Capacity reading? (it's not ""Battery Health"", it's ""Maximum Capacity"", located in the Battery Health section of the Battery settings).

Finally, do you restart your iPhone regularly? That keeps battery level readings reasonably accurate in between recalibrations.",,1
1423,gy35j4,the maximum capacity is 50% because of had this phone for a long time,,1
1424,gy35j4,will try. and the maximum capacity is 50%,,1

1432,gy1n3c,"check it with a third party battery app on a computer, like Coconut Battery on Mac (not sure about Windows apps).  It'll give you more information about the battery health.
It's probably fine though, I noticed battery health % can fluctuate a little sometimes, so it might go back up.",,1

1437,gy01zx,"There is a PC application called 3utools which you can use to see how many cycles the battery has been through. iPhone batteries last about 500 cycles, so if yours is showing 400+ cycles, then it is worth considering replacing the battery. However, this may not diagnose any other faults or issues with the device. 

The issue of heating up whilst charging may be due to a dying battery or by a different issue.

You may want to ask the repair shop to have a look at the device (opening up and poking around) to see if there are any other issues and they may charge a fee for this.",,2

1439,gy01zx,"Okay, thanks for the help",,1
1440,gy01zx,Is the charge times the charge cycles?,,1
1441,gy01zx,"One charge cycle is the battery discharge from 100% to 0%.

If you discharge the battery to 50% and charge it up. Discharge it to 50% and charge it up, then that is one charge cycle. 

As the battery ages from time and discharge cycles, it will become less efficient. By about 500 cycles, the battery would show approximately 80% capacity. The Iphone 6 capacity is 1810mAh, after 500 cycles, it would have about 1448mAh (80%). This will show up as ""100%"".",,1

does this mean you've done a restore in itunes?  or just erased all the settings?

usually a restore is seen as a complete ground-up reinstallation of ios.  if that doesn't fix it, it's hardware.

so the apple techs haven't physically seen it?  are apple stores near you opened?   They might swap it out there if they can test it.

have you made records of when this issue occurs?  I guess you could contest it with your credit card company if they falsely charge you.  By then you'll have a new phone, hopefully that doesn't fail, so that's proof it was the phone.",,1

If you in fact reset the phone, and put your sim in, as you step through the setup and sign into your iCloud you get the ""Activation Error""?

I see this a lot with the iPhone 7, possibly one of the worst designed iPhones thus far. The amount of issues caused from motherboard bending etc.

If you could infact get past the ""Activation Error"" you would find the phone would have the ""No Sim"" issue and not be able to connect to the network.

Free space inside the iPhone is very limited. It depends on the size of the part that broke off to determine if it will be stuck inside the sim-tray or will move inside the phone.

The XR has same internals as XS and 11 has same internals as 11 pro, just smaller battery, less cameras, and lcd. LCD is very high quality and its literally perfect. 

I say buy a brand new XR(if you can find one) or a Brand new 11. The screen is 6.1 inches(compared to 5.8 and 6.5 inches on 11 pro and max respectively) and has an amazing display. Battery life is very long, and can even last you two days with a battery case. 

I say don’t buy anything 8 plus or below. Not worth it for the money rn. Also, X would be the lowest I would go. Btw, be careful when buying pre-owned or used. Check the IMEI, check the ESN status, and make sure they are paid off. Also, be sure the displays don’t have too much burn in if you are buying a OLED display phone.

I keep moving 200 - 300mb videos and deleting them after (and removing from recently deleted) and my space may go to about 1.1 - 1.3gb free but within a few hours or day or two, it’s back to 500-800 mb range. I’m not installing anything or taking new pictures or videos.

Since it's not a genuine Apple battery (obviously since iPhone 7 came out in 2016), the Maximum Capacity reading might never be accurate.

All the photos and stuff should be mashed together. I have never tried this tho. Trying to get android and ios to work together, from personal experience, just becomes a complete disaster. If you can’t get the migration from android to ios to work properly, then maybe you can ask her carrier to do it. Idk how this works tho. Best of luck!

If she still finds him, idk what to tell you. Maybe she is asking around to see where he is, or she put some kind of physical gps thingy in his stuff. Does the building have signal, and does she have access to his location via a tracking app (like “Find”)?",,1

I only have about 6-7000 photos at the moment, before “system” took up all this space my phone could hold about 12,000 photos. It seems that the more i delete photos, the more “system” takes up, so I’m afraid it might be corrupted data or corrupt storage (from filling it up and deleting over and over so many times)",,1

Basically, if you don’t have enough iCloud storage to hold your photo library, don’t enable iCloud Photo Library.

Regardless, I took a risk (didn’t want to clean the alcohol odour off my hands after such an approach, and I was already right at the sink where there was conveniently soap and water 😬) and it looks like it went badly. I’m hoping it comes around though. So far I’ve waited around 18 hours for any remaining liquid to evaporate (although I’ve been using my device during that time and it wasn’t completely turned off and left alone), and the haptic feedback/vibration still hasn’t returned.

I’d just taken a risk out of convenience, since I’d already been at a sink in my bathroom where there was soap and water right nearby.

2821,gkkgb3,"Shut down your iPhone. Don't do any of this until it is completely powered off.

Fold up a paper towel into a tiny square, soak it with water, squeeze out some of the water but not all of it. Maybe leave about half the amount of water in it. You want this little square to be like a soaked sponge that is holding water but not dripping wet.

Orient your iPhone so that volume buttons are on top.

Now, use this paper towel ""sponge"" to squeeze out the remaining water over the buttons repeatedly by pressing the paper towel square ""sponge"" against the buttons.. You're rinsing out whatever has made the button become sticky/mushy. It's ok to press the buttons with the paper towel. In fact, I recommend it.

Do not run the iPhone under water as an alternative way to do this. I repeat: do not do it. This paper towel method is far safer. Yes, it's still risky, but if your Xr has no defects, the water you repeatedly squeeze out shouldn't go inside.

Do this a few times. By that, I mean, get more water into your little paper towel ""sponge"", squeeze maybe half of it out and then press it against the buttons again to try to rinse out whatever is in there.

When you've done it maybe 2-3 times altogether, you should use a dry paper towel to press the buttons and you should blow very hard around the entire circumference of the buttons to further help get the water out of there.

Now, test the buttons. If they are both clicky again, you may turn the iPhone back on. If this didn't solve the problem at all, then, well of course you can turn the iPhone back on but I would take it to an Apple store and have them look at it.

I have an iPhone 11 and I had a lemonade spill near my iPhone and some of it splashed against the Sleep/Wake button. A few hours later, my Sleep/Wake button lost its clicky feel and sound and it would stick as well. I did exactly as I described above and it restored it 100%.",,1

Each app is in its own sandbox. This is every app, like even the system apps like Photos and Music. No app can have access unless it is done through the system or explicitly permitted. Even as far as I know, the Files app is it’s own sandbox.
Now, iTunes (or any app like AnyTrans that is able to pretend to be iTunes) has access to a few of these sandboxes, like Photos, contacts, Music, etc. So the way you can add music to your phone is through those programs. They will not reside in your files, they will reside in Music’s sandbox.
You can use iTunes or an alternative.
The way “music player” apps get access to that music is that they prompt you to allow them to communicate with Music’s sandbox.

App developers are who dictate what apps are available in the store, what devices those apps support, and what software those apps will work on. It’s why there are some apps that are available on the iPhone that aren’t available on the iPad even if they run the same up to date iOS version.",,2

another question .most apps on android target android 4.4.4 .

on IOS what is generally the most targeted version ?",,1

3165,ggej4d,"I would assume the third version supports the App Store, I didn’t get into iPhones until the 4th gen.... as for which apps work with which versions.... there really isn’t a way to determine that.... it’s all app developer specific. One app development company may have multiple apps that do different things, and because those apps do different things, hardware and security feature  requirements may be different, so dictates which version of iOS is supported.

For example, an app that supports a form of payment method would have different security requirements than say a game application. So the game application MAY be able to be run on a lower software/device version than the payment application, even though they are created by the same developer. 

It also comes down to who the app was written for. Devices get replaced and upgraded, so you see far more iPhone 8’s than you do iPhone 5’s. Would you spend money supporting a device/software that is only used by a small fraction of users, or would you concentrate on devises/software that has a larger user base? If you make money supporting the larger user base, but loose money on the smaller user base, it becomes an easy choice for the developers.",,1

Its not so much getting them to not use the cloud for everything, I like the idea of sharing stuff between my devices. Honestly, between that and the icloud email addresses, is the only reason I continue to use my iphone...and facetime and walkie talkie on the apple watch.

The big thing that i dont like is that simple fact that when you take pictures or videos, you have to go through holy hell in order to get any of them on your computer at all...and the issue with transferring any of them to icloud then bringing them to your computer that way, causes you to lose a bit of the resolution and stuff...cause like, they advertise good lookin pictures and videos, but if you do THAT, it loses something...

Plus, who the hell wants to sit there for hours (maybe) to download a very large, or multi part 4k video, and risk some kinda transfer issue happening and losing some or all of it during the download?

The easiest way to get a copy of all of the photos in iCloud is to use iCloud for Windows and download them as I believe you said you are doing. 

Alternative method would be to turn off iCloud Photos on the phone, tell it to download and keep originals, and then copy them from the folders on the phone as you used to. I imagine this may not be an option with the number of photos you are trying to copy.",,3

3574,gcf797,"Go to [Imgur.com](https://Imgur.com) and click New Post in the top left corner. Then you can either drag and drop the image into the box, or click Choose photo/video to browse your computer files. Choose your image and then hover over it with your mouse, and click Copy Link, in the top right corner of the image. Then go to reddit, edit post, and replace the old iCloud link, and paste in the copied one from imgur. Feel free to ask, if you have any questions.",,1

have you hooked it up to a computer and itunes? see if it recognizes it",,5
3576,gc9fqd,"If it is just a dead battery, it’s not the end of the world. Those can be replaced. If you need the data off of it, I would take it to a phone repair shop and have them replace the battery. If the data isn’t important, then I would put that money towards a newer phone.",,4
3577,gc9fqd,I bought a new battery on amazon,,1
3578,gc9fqd,Are you going to install it yourself? Be extra careful when pulling the screen up. Do it slowly and only open it a bit. The ribbon cable that goes from the home button to the logic board needs to be detached before the screen can come all the way off. It is easily damaged.,,3
3579,gc3mop,"Hard to tell just by looking at the outside (also, the imgur pictures just show us as black for me). Things I would look for:

* Do the two screws at the bottom show any sign of being taken out, Andy scratches on them?

* Is the screen on tight? Are there any gaps or places where it doesn’t fit perfectly into the frame?

* Does the screen look brand new, but there is lots of wear on the body?

* Is the battery health at 100%? And original battery for a phone that old would not have full battery health. 

These are all just indicators and not proof that work has been done. The only way to know is to open it up and look for third party parts.",,2
3580,gc2pa3,You will have to do a DFU reset. Data will be lost but it’s already to late for your data.,,2
3581,gc2pa3,You won’t be able to downgrade it tho. iTunes will ALWAYS force the newest version to be downloaded and installed.,,2
3582,gc2pa3,"Let me know if you find a solution, I’ve got an iPhone 7 that does the exact same thing. I think the NAND chip might be fucked but idk... it’s iCloud locked anyway",,1
3583,gc2pa3,Thanks for the suggestion :) I tried to put the iPhone in DFU mode and it worked. But the restoring process in iTunes keeps on failing several times huhuhu. It restarted once more and caused to make another unknown error. Does downgrading the iPhone instead of restoring to the latest version help solve the problem? Thank you again!,,1
3584,gc2pa3,"Geez, I guess third-party software might do the trick. Still gonna find ways to make this phone up and running. Thanks!",,2
3585,gc2pa3,"Sure sure, I’ll update you. I’m planning to fix the phone after the home quarantine here in our country. Most cellphone repair vendors are closed here.",,1
3586,gc2pa3,"Np, good luck!",,1
3587,gc1720,What’s happening exactly?,,1
3588,gbyq71,You have to completely reinstall iOS.,,2
3589,gbyq71,"You should DFU restore to stock, then either setup as new or restore a backup from before the jailbreak was applied.

I’d be more interested in why you ‘couldn’t get the update’",,1
3590,gbyq71,Why?,,0
3591,gbyq71,If I restore will the update still be available?,,1
3592,gbyq71,Jailbreaking puts files deep into iOS file system that can’t be deleted manually.,,2
3593,gbyq71,"Should be.

What model device?

What were you running before the update?

What are you running now?",,1
3594,gbyq71,So should I rejailbreak then?,,0
3595,gbyq71,I’m on iOS 12.4 and iOS 13 is available now thanks to the jailbreak but it says the iPhone will try to update later tonight.,,1
3596,gbyq71,No?? You should make a backup and reinstall iOS.,,2
3597,gbyq71,What model iPhone?,,1
3598,gbyq71,Ok I will thanks man,,1
3599,gbyq71,iPhone XR,,1
3600,gbyq71,"iOS 13 is available for that model, something was blocking the update.

Is it a managed device, does it (or rather did it) have any config profiles, or was it jailbroken previously?",,1
3601,gbyq71,It was jailbroken previously but I deleted it. And just now I’m jailbreaking it again so I can I update I didn’t think it would work but it did,,0
3602,gbyq71,">it was jailbroken previously 

And there it is 🙄

How did you ‘delete’ the jailbreak?",,1
3603,gbyq71,I just deleted the app,,-1
3604,gbyq71,"🤦🏻‍♂️

That doesn’t undo what’s been changed to the base OS.

So what happened is that jailbreaking deliberately break updates (since updates aren’t tested against jailbroken devices and can cause data destroying issues).

You never removed the jailbreak, so updates were still broken.

DFU restore to stock to *correctly* remove all traces of jailbreak, and  iTunes/Finder will install 13.4.1 during setup.",,1
3605,gbyq71,Pls don’t ever jailbreak because you can’t just delete unc0ver you have to delete Cydia,,1
3606,gbyq71,I did jailbreak my phone a second time but this time I enabled allow updates,,0
3607,gbyq71,"So?

>DFU restore to stock to correctly remove all traces of jailbreak, and  iTunes/Finder will install 13.4.1 during setup.

iOS updates are not tested against jailbreaks... that’s why they deliberately break updating.",,1
3608,gbypwp,"Likely water damage.

Turn it off.",,1
3609,gbypwp,That rust is corrosion. Unfortunately the worst think to do after a phone gets wet is plugging it into a charger or powering it on. Your best bet is to take it to a repair shop to replace the charging port and make sure there's no board damage.,,1
3610,gbypwp,If you never have repaired a iPhone I would tell you NO! Also just replacing the charging port may fix it but the motherboard still has water damage you will need to soak in in 99% isopropyl and NO RICE I mean no rice ever for a iPhone,,1
3611,gbypwp,New charging port will not fix it,,1
3612,gbypwp,"yes I know, but can it be saved? Maybe hard reset?",,1
3613,gbypwp,Do u think theres a big chance of being the charging port?,,1
3614,gbypwp,I habe repaired before,,2
3615,gbypwp,Also adding since you opened in I would suggest a new screen. That can also cause the boot loop but if you can get it into dfu to show update and update the device does it show 4013?,,1
3616,gbypwp,">maybe hard reset

🤨. A software reset isn’t gonna undo hardware damage.

Turn it off, place it in an airtight container with desiccant and leave it for a while.  (Ideally, remove the display assembly and disconnect the battery).

Or take it to a repair shop.",,1
3617,gbypwp,It sounds like the charging port is shot for sure but there's a chance that when it was plugged into the charger it shorted something else out as well causing the boot loop,,1
3618,gbypwp,Yes that was the error that shows. What is it?,,1
3619,gbypwp,Do u think it would go into boot loop if the charging port is fucked?,,1
3620,gbypwp,Lol your NAND is fried the phone is gone. You will need a solder but I haven’t even gotten that fixed. You will need a new phone,,1
3621,gbypwp,It's possible but a tech would need to open it up to know for sure,,1
3622,gbypwp,Well my friend took to ubreakifix and they bs saying it was the screen that was damage. I thought it would also be the charging port but im uncertain,,1
3623,gbypwp,A bad screen probably wouldn't cause a boot loop but it is possible. If there's corrosion on the charging port it almost will definitely need a new one. Unfortunately water damage like that will sometimes also mean board level repairs,,1
3624,gbypwp,I would recommend cross posting to r/mobilerepair and see what they have to say,,1
3625,gbypwp,Yeah i figured. Might as well try it. Its $8 on ebay for a new charging port,,1
3626,gbypwp,there's only corrosion on the charging port tho,,1
3627,gbypwp,"That's the only visible corrosion but there could be more on the underside of the board or under one of the covers on the board. Hopefully it's just the charging port, but there's a chance it's not",,1
3628,gbtaby,We don’t know what you’re talking about.,,3
3629,gbtaby,Could be a faulty display 🤷🏻‍♂️,,1
3630,gbtaby,"almost like its burned into the display? if so, happened to mine. goes away after awhilr",,1
3631,gbtaby,"YES! it’s been about 4 days, how long did it take to go away?",,1
3632,gbtaby,no clue just didnt see it anymore,,1

3636,gbord1,Is this feature available in the free version?,,1

I always do it the traditional way, using an encrypted backup on my Mac.",,2
3642,gbktti,"I did the same thing and mine is holding up really good every day even with lots of on-screen usage.

However, you should expect a lot of downloading going on in the background the first day or two after switching. So it might just be because it's fetching a ton of the old stuff.

Try waiting a day or two more and then take it back to the store or send it in if the issue persists.",,2

3644,gbktti,Call Tim Apple directly.,,5
3645,gbfoza,"I think it’s meant to work that way, so scrolling down isn’t affected by accidental sideways motion.

It’s never bothered my personally, but feel free to send feedback to Apple.

And you really should update.  13.4.1 is the current iOS version",,1
3646,gbfoza,Thanks. Always worried to update since I hear it’s very difficult to downgrade software after if you experience glitches.,,0

Or updating to the next beta ;-)",,1

Upgrading from a computer seems to result in a more stable iOS.",,1
3660,gbcjru,"That’s okay. 
You can simply hard re-set your iOS device (and not lose any data) by holding down the power button & the volume up button until the screen goes black.
