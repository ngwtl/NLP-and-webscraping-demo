My story sounds like this: since everybody knows, electronics/devices in USA are cheaper and(as far as I know) better quality, I bought 2 iPhone 11 from west coast of US via a friend of mine in december 2019. I gave the money to this friend, he delivered me the 2 phones and after this he told me that I need to wait a few months in order to activate them because he didnt’t paid them full or something like this. Ok, I knew that something is wrong from the begining, but that was not my first priority. Today there are about 7 months since i have the phones, he told me that he hardly paid them full a few days ago but they are still locked on T-Mobile, so i cannot use them, and he also told me that I need to send the 2 phones back in the US for 2-3 days in order to be activated. Now I am asking you guys because you know better, especially the ones living in the US, is it mandatory to send the phones back just to be activated? How am I supposed to find out what is really happening there? What kind of offers were 7-8 months ago? 
Thank you so much in advance!",,4,1.0

And yet here we are: the iOS updated either automatically or because he hit some thing, and after seeing “hello” In multiple languages, it asks for the six digit security code that was 100% certainly not set up.

I have seen online this can happen after an OS updates but I don’t know the next step. Entering the default code of “123456” or “000000” does not work.

Are there reliable third-party tools out there that will allow me to plug this phone in, mount it as a hard drive and take his pictures off When the phone is in such a pre-security code state?

Alternately, have you heard of this bug and is there a way around it to resume function as normal?

17,My speaker doesn’t work anymore !!,hc4kid,2020-06-19 17:10:48,"I was listening to music, casually, volume all the way up, then suddenly the volume drops down and sounds kinda muffled, when I got to the phone, I noticed that the bottom speaker doesn’t work anymore, the sound only comes out of the earpiece, I have an iPhone 8.

Here are the things I tried: blowing air into the speaker, shaking it a little bit (It may be dumb but you never know), [apple’s recommendations](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203794), water eject although it hadn’t been anywhere near water (that reminds me I had resorted to this around 2 months ago, some water had gotten into one of the speakers, or maybe both, but I eventually got it out (which again reminds me, I think around that same time I experienced something similar, only then I was on Instagram, got the phone to my ear to listen to an audio, and it was stuck on outputting from the earpiece, it worked fine after a simple reboot) I don’t know if any of this is relevant), making a call on speaker works but only through the top speaker, plugging and unplugging headphones, on and off Bluetooth, rebooting, reset settings, and only then did I remember hard reboot was an option, and since it still didn’t work, I tried it too. Finally I tried cleaning up the lightning port and the speaker grill with a sharpened q-tip, although there wasn’t much to clean.

I think the next step is to factory reset, but I’d like to see if there’s anything else I can do.

I saw a video somewhere where they had a similar issue and fixed it by deleting an app that “controls the speakers”, I haven’t installed any new app, is there a way to see which apps do that?, but I guess if that was the case resetting settings should’ve solved it?

Could you help me figure out what could’ve happened? I didn’t really drop it that day (yesterday, this happened ~18h ago), didn’t get no shock or any particular damage. It just happened out of nowhere. Could it be that something disconnected? How? Why? Or maybe the speaker is just dead and needs to be replaced ?

- Dropped it a day or two ago and won't turn back on, usually when this happened I could fix it by charging it and it will force to turn on. What happened when I did that was it shows the Apple logo and it would turn off again and stuck in that loop.

- Took it for repair and learned that the battery was ok and the phone most likely needed a factory reset, took them an hour to no avail but assured that it could be fixed though I took the phone anyway and went home.

- Tried iTunes and Fonepaw, usually when the recovery is about the start, the phone restarts (when in recovery mode) and then the Apple logo with the loading will show up (based on videos I've watched). This doesn't happened on me and it would just go back to recovery mode and iTunes and Fonepaw would show me error.

I just noticed my proximity sensor isn't working when on a call (edit: hasn't worked since I have it), be it a normal phone call or voip. However, the faint red light from the sensor is visible in the dark.

When I replace the battery I'll ask them to check the proximity sensor too, maybe the ebay seller changed the screen before selling and damaged something in there, no idea. But how come the sensor's red light is there when it's not working?

Also it came with a screen protector, could that be the reason the sensor doesn't detect anything? Tried with my finger too, nothing. Front facing camera works fine, screen is always clean.

Iphone 11 Pro, current iOs version

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

USA, through verizon wireless, April 2020

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**
So im in a semi long distance relationship, 2 hours away, and my significant other and I enjoy video chatting each other when im not close by. She has an Android Samsung Galaxy S10. When we first started video chatting, I had an Iphone X and we used Whatsapp messenger for our video calls. We had ZERO issues when it came to her hearing me and I hearing her. Sometimes I would just regular facetime her work phone which is an iPHone X as well, and everything worked.

My Iphone X shit the bed, and I had to upgrade. I got an Iphone 11 pro. Since day ONE, facebook messenger, facetime app, and whatsapp ALL have ""hearing"" issues. What I mean by this is, the video works fine on both wifi and cellular data. However, 75% of the time, she only hears every other word or sometimes even every 4th or 5th word. Its bad. To the point that we dont video chat much anymore because theres no point due to she cant get what im saying.

Please, there HAS to be a solution. I called Verizon Wireless and because of COVID, they were not much help and told me to basically restart my device and do all that basic stuff. This is not a restart my phone and its fixed type of issue.

**4. What caused the issue?**

I have no idea.  It did this issue from day 1 when I activated it from Verizon.

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

Restarted phone.  Tried both on data and wifi, different messaging apps, etc",,1,1.0

54,What's the appeal of wireless charging for iPhones?,hau790,2020-06-17 16:09:59,"I have an iPhone XS and I recently picked up an Anker Powerwave pad to try out wireless charging.  So far, I'm not sure I totally understand the appeal of it.

Wireless charging:
- is slower than a high amperage lightning connection (USB Power Delivery)
- requires a more precise positioning than a wired connection (several times I've woken up in the morning with an uncharged phone, having accidentally nudged it off the pad in my sleep)
- prevents the use of other useful rear-mounted phone accessories like magnet car mounts and Pop Sockets
- doesn't continue to charge while you are using the phone (since you've lifted it up from the charging pad)

The only upsides that I can see is that you reduce the daily wear & tear on the lighting port, and that placing it on a pad is somewhat faster and more convenient than reaching for a cable and plugging it in.

I'd love to embrace a wonderful future without wires, but I don't really see the upsides right now.  Am I missing something?",,13,0.94

iMessage not working. Gets activation unsuccessful. 

**4. What caused the issue?**

This is my daughter's phone so it's hard to know for sure when it started or why.. She mentioned continuously getting prompted for iCloud password and also that it wasn't working (but not sure she knows it for sure). She also mentioned something about a number she didn't recognize when she tried to reset her password for iCloud.

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

I have tried pretty much everything I found on the internet..

* Reset Network Settings
* Reboot iPhone
* Disabled iMessage, FaceTime, signed out of iCloud, waited over night, signed in to iCloud, tried to activate iMessage and it failed.
* Erased phone and restored from backup
* Tried just on LTE, just on WIFI
* Reseated the SIM card

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

What's weird is when you go into Settings > Messages and you hit the ""Send & Receive"" under iMessage.. On mine it shows my apple id at the top, grayed out, then under ""You can receive imessages to and reply from"" it has my phone number (grayed out), my icloud account, and my gmail account.. It has a check mark by all of them

On hers, under the you can receive she has her phone number and her [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) account.. Only the icloud account has a checkmark.. When you try to select her phone number it spins for about 3 seconds and then nothing happens..  No checkmark..

96,Pretty sure my iPhone X officially died tonight... is there any way to get my info off of it?,h99v0b,2020-06-15 05:36:10,"1. iPhone X running what I’m guessing is the newest iOS as I update it routinely.

2. I think I purchased the phone in February 2018 so warranty is long gone.

3. So today at the pool I was taking pictures of my boyfriend and baby in the water and I got it wet briefly. I didn’t really think of it as a big deal because I’ve definitely had it in the water the first summer I had it and taken pictures. But then all of a sudden the screen turned off. I didn’t think much about it because the apple comes up on the screen. 

So when we get inside from the pool the screen has the apple comes up and will go back off & then I got the support.apple.com/iPhone/restore screen. I hard restarted it & it came up again, but then when I plug it into my laptop iTunes doesn’t recognize it as being plugged in so I can’t restore it. I just went ahead and ordered a new phone to be picked up tomorrow because my phone is critical for work. I’m guessing that my X is completely toast & I have it set to backup to iCloud but I can’t really figure out how to tell when the last update was? I’m assuming everything that I did on my phone today is gone (including the photos from the first time my baby went swimming which I’m now an emotional mother about) but how can I tell when my last back up actually was? 

Face ID stopped working about maybe a year or so ago, I attributed that to my having dropped the phone quite a lot (thank god for a strong case!) and knocked something out of whack. I’m guessing when it got wet this time it just ruined something and it doesn’t want to work now.

I haven’t tried anything other than hard restarting the phone twice (put it in a bag of rice now, but the phone actually seems to be turning on if the apple is showing up??) and plugging it into my laptop but that’s all. I’m open to any information about how to possibly get the phone restored so I can continue use, or how to pull any pictures from today off of it possibly. I guess I’ll finally start uploading my photos to the cloud - this is what I get for not doing it!

The normal way to factory reset an iPhone 4 is to hold the home and power button down, but the home button is broken so I have to find another way.

I researched and found that an app called ""recboot"" and another app called ""reiboot"" are tools that will allow me to force the phone into recovery drf mode without the buttons. From there I would be able to use iTunes to restore the phone.

There’s tabs that I wanted to use later on and didn’t screenshot what they were or save the links to email or notes. So is there a way to restore or just bring back the history to see what I had? Or is there no luck to recover it?,,1,1.0

I’ve used less than 2GB. Last month I used 12GB and it still ran like normal. All I’m wondering is if it’s possible for the speed to be affected by the hotspot being on. 

I just realized that I left my personal hotspot on my iPhone X on about two weeks ago and it’s been on ever since. My data has been ridiculously slow lately, and I’m curious whether it might be because my hotspot was on? I’d test it now but where I am at the moment there’s no cell reception so I am on WiFi anyway.",,1,0.99
142,Do not receive notifications or badges for Facebook or IG,h7uocd,2020-06-12 22:31:42,"Edit 2: this only solved the issue immediately following and testing with FB.  It no longer works. On hold with Apple now. I’ll report back if anything of use happens 


EDIT: I solved it by restoring the settings.  Bit of a pain in the butt, but it was the only thing that worked.

Leaving this up in case someone else comes searching for help on this as there's lots of questions on Apple Support about this since last week with no solutions, so it sounds like it's happening to a few people.




<<<<<<<<<<<
I had notifications turned off for both for a long time. Recently I decided to reenact them.  Upon doing so,  they cease to show up.

I thought maybe it was because of the latest iOS update. 

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling both apps.  Checked my settings on both the app and on my phone. 

Notifications for my messages do work. 

Has anyone had this issue?

I just switched from Samsung to iPhone. With Samsung, when I want to call someone I can use the keypad to ""write"" the name of a contact and it will appear as a suggestion. For instance ""Mike"":

Long story short my  iTunes/App Store account that I’ve used since 2008 has been disabled. I never got a reason why but I’m sure I know. I had to contact my credit card company because I got billed twice for the same item on a video game app and I didn’t have time to wait for Apple to take their two weeks to sort it to refund me. 

So it sucks my account is disabled but whatever. I then took it off my iPhone and removed it from my cloud etc. I made a brand new iTunes/App Store account but when I went to install something I got the same message about my account being disabled. So that tells me that somehow something else is sticking around to identify me and stop me from making a new account. I’m sure there’s a way around this and I’m hoping you guys can help. I can’t figure out what’s stopping me from using a new account unless it’s my phone number? 

If worse comes to worse I’ll call Apple up and try to get them to restore my account and enable it but that’s such a pain. They no longer have email that I can tell and I despise talking on the phone to these people.

I plugged the phone into my computer and the iTunes said that I need to restore it. I didn't want to lose all the data on it, so I started searching for a solution.

I tried 3uTools and in the program it said that my phone is in DFU mode. That time I realised that the phone didn't have anything to do with a faulty battery. I tried restoring it by selecting there ""retain user data"" option. But it didn't work, it said that it could not enter restore mode.

I tried a couple of apps like Reiboot, Dr.Fone,PhoneRescue, but still not succes.

I realised I could not save the data on it, so I needed a full restore of the device. I tried using the iTunes method but it gave me the error 4014.

I tried using the other apps I used before but still I cannot restore my iPhone.

I use google photos and all my iPhone pictures are backed up there. Is it safe for me to delete all my iPhone photos on my old device, so that when I sign into iCloud on my new device, they aren’t downloaded onto my new phone? And then maybe I don’t even need to restore the old back up, I can just start fresh and re-download my apps manually? 

I know nothing of how this stuff works so I’m not sure if that’s a dumb idea or not. But like I said, I just want a fresh start on my iPhone so that’s what I’m attempting. Is there anything I should know about choosing not to restore my back up that could make this a bad idea? 

Any advice is much appreciated! Thanks in advance!",,1,1.0

Im having an issue with the Music app on my iPhone (8+, latest iOS)

I switched regions yesterday, if that even matters.

I CAN stream music with my subscription; however, I can’t see my library (it’s stuck in Loading Library...), I can’t add music to my library (no prompt), I can’t deactivate Sync Library (the switch goes off, but comes back on if I refresh). 

Everything’s working perfectly in my Mac.

I’ve tried resetting the phone; reinstalling the app; signing out and in - as per Apple’s instruction (all I could get from support was: “your account is ok, so there’s that”)

I can’t seem to fix it. I’d love if anyone can help me out today!

I'm not very interested in phones or up to date with models and releases but I'm pretty sure it's an Iphone 8 plus and it probably has the most up to date iOS

2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

It's my work phone, I didn't buy it. I live in Sweden but this has so far only happened to me and my colleagues while working on a project in Germany.

3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

Today I saw it happen in front of my eyes, I pulled up my phone to take a picture and as I was about to snap the picture the screen just started showing thin white vertical lines on a grey background, the screen became brighter and brighter for thirty seconds until it went all black. It reacts to no buttons, nothing happens when I put in the charger, when I ask someone to call me it's like it's turned off. But last time it happened to me and to most of my colleagues, it will just start working in a couple of days again.

It occurs when we weld. At a certain stage of my job we have a 10 hour shift where we TIG-weld copper. It is somehow related to that because it always happen during that shift but while I'm annoyed I'm dying to know the exact cause. We only have DC in our TIG torches when welding copper. It's a fairly powerful welding machine able to output upwards 450 Ampere required for copper welding.

4. What caused the issue?

I'm not sure about the exact cause. Today when it happened the welding machine was turned on standing maybe 1,5 meters away but noone was running it since maybe 30 minutes. 

5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

Me and my colleagues try to not wear the phones in our pockets while we weld. We need to be able to take photos and to be reached, so I still kept them around, so I guess at this point a solution to have it not happen in the future is to keep the phone in another building as we do this but that's annoying.

6. Any other information you think might be useful.

We think it's only these newer Iphones it's happening to. But it also only happens when we're in Germany. Maybe that's all a coincidence but it's just so weird. I moved the SIM-card to another, older Samsung phone, and it's working fine. Maybe it's relevant, the item we weld is high voltage DC conductors for power transmission.

Does anyone have any ideas what it might be doing this, or how I could get my phone to start working again right away?",,19,0.96

247,High Data Usage,gyv8yk,2020-06-08 08:15:09,"My mother downloaded an app called ""Planet Cam"" and it used 53GB mobile data in just a few hours. That is just insane and as far as I am concerned only possible if many videos are continuously being played back at the same time.
Moreover, she only used it a few short times within this period.

I have read about an iOS bug, but it is just this one app, acting up and not a high usage overall.
Does anyone know about this app? Or about what could be the reason? Could it really be iOS that is causing the problem?",,1,1.0

So my phone is 4-ish years old iPhone 7, and it’s never given me a problem until recently. I would wake up some mornings starting around a month ago and a notification would pop up that said “cellular update failed”. I wasn’t even aware of what a cellular update was or that it was happening. It would not allow me to use cellular data at all. The only solutions to this were to update the phone or do a hard reset. It would be fixed immediately, if not by the next morning. These methods have been working for a few weeks, but last night and all day today it has said No Service all the time no matter what, and that in order to use cellular data on this iPhone, I have to update, but I can’t because it’s up to date at 13.5.1.

253,iPhone XR Texting Freeze,gyo84k,2020-06-08 00:21:04,"My iPhone XR will sporadically freeze and crash while texting within the Messages app. It seems to be worse in the evening, when I have used it throughout the day. It is limited to texting pretty much only, but I have experienced issues with streaming music on cellular data (using Spotify specifically). I have the most recent version of iOS  (13.5.1) and have had this issue through the last two versions.  


Troubleshooting done with no solution:  
Verified no storage issues (128 gb iPhone with 50+ gigs left)

Turned off background app refresh

Used Apple brand chargers and wall adapters

Removed and reinstalled a multitude of apps

Reset iPhone and restored from backup

Restored iPhone straight from backup (trying to avoid starting all over again)

Turned off push notifications for email and other apps  


The iPhone is in relatively good shape and has been dropped a handful of times with a case. 

Has anyone else experienced an issue like this? It is ONLY with the Messages app, and once it starts freezing, it pretty much will not stop and texting becomes impossible. A restart has no affect on the freezes and crashing. Before I go through the effort of calling Apple or doing anything further, is there a fix for this? Anything else I can try?

The phone is under warranty, but I am not sure if Apple will do anything for an issue like this.",,1,1.0

This is how it looks when I wipe it with some water

the partial area somehow appear to be hydrophilic? now. I mean water slides off easily from the other parts of the screen like it should however it simply stays on those spots as if something that had once been there repelling water is not there anymore? I'm not sure at all.

263,I got locked out of my iPhone 8+,gy96g4,2020-06-07 09:29:50,"Hi everyone.

Two days ago, my iPhone of nearly 2 years stopped functioning normally. None of my alarms rang that morning - I couldn't click on anything. I restarted my phone a couple of times only to be stuck at the Apple logo for hours. 

I did a hard reset and plugged my phone into my laptop to get it into recovery mode. I had it install an update, but my laptop suddenly went on sleep mode and lost all its progress. I was left with no choice but to restore my phone. And I did. 

After restoring, my phone prompts a message to say about 'remote management' and that a certain company (I won't name) has control over my phone. An apple tech guy also walked me through recovery mode, but we got the same result. His hunch is that this phone used to belong to that company and only decided to lock it now (and that he'll help me escalate this problem next week, but that my homework is to contact the company). I restored my phone 4 times in total that day. 

Let's just say I wasn't received with warmth by the company, and they may not be the solution to my problem. I contacted the seller too, who was happy to reply and escalate to his supplier (he has 100% rating on eBay, and I was sure at least then that I bought this phone brand new - I even checked it with my serial ID and it says I have a valid purchase date). He said he'll keep me posted. 

I guess at this point, I'm trying to think about my options (buying a new phone being the very last resort). Is there any way I can go around this, or is my iPhone useless now? (I'm located in Australia, if that's of any help warranty-wise).

276,Intermittent cell signal loss. Apple blames carrier. Carrier blames Apple. Frustrated.,gxwrc8,2020-06-06 18:55:50,"**Summary of issue:** Several times per day, my iPhone 11 Pro will suddenly completely lose cell service. It’ll go from 4 bars to 0 bars, during which time I can’t place calls or use cellular data. This happens in several different geographic locations so it’s not a signal issue. Furthermore, my work phone uses the same carrier and doesn’t have these issues. After a minute or two, the service returns and it works like usual. 

**What I’ve done to try to fix it:** My first move was to call Apple since I have AppleCare+. Apple had me take several troubleshooting steps including checking for Carrier Setting Updates, Resetting Network Settings, and erasing the phone and starting over as a new phone. None of these solutions fixed my problem. 

Next, they had me call my carrier (FirstNet, which uses AT&T towers). My carrier reprovisioned the phone, and then sent me a physical SIM card to replace the eSIM which I had been using. Neither of these fixed the issue. 

Back to Apple, who me install a profile to collect more detailed Baseband logs. Engineers at Apple still blame my carrier based on the logs. 

I’ve been having this problem for over a month now. I told Apple I’d like a new phone since I think it’s pretty clearly a hardware issue. They warned me repeatedly that I’d be charged the full retail price of the phone if they aren’t able to replicate the issue. This issue is so infrequent that I seriously worry they won’t be able to reproduce the issue and I’ll be screwed out of $1,000.

281,iPhone 7 recover photos/videos after Reset procedure possible?,gxucll,2020-06-06 16:44:23,"Hi,

I consider myself tech-oriented, have a lot of experience with tech gear, software, computers etc. Just to clear that line out.

Now, I don't personally use iPhone, my colleagues and friends around me do and I have limited experience, e.g. performed setup and registrations for friends in the past, installed few apps and so on.

And one important friend just had a **weird accident with her iPhone 7**. The internal memory was full, she cleared few old photos and videos to make some room for new ones, and decided to **restart (reboot)** the phone to see if it will make it run smoother.

And that's when the problem occurred. The phone shown a message that it is now **locked and to connect to iTunes to unlock it**. That message does not happen unless you make a mistake **10 times to try to unlock it (brute force protection)**, but she **denies** that that ever happened. It's her own phone, not stolen one obviously, and she **never changed her password** in the last 3 (or 4?) years.

Anyhow, she gave me the phone to try recover it, since her laptop is some ancient one on Win 7 and iTunes no longer works properly there (phone requires newer version).

I installed iTunes on my Win 10 laptop, everything went fine, phone was started in recovery mode, but during the ""update"" recovery procedure (non-destructive) phone stopped the update process, and iTunes reported that it cannot be updated because of an unknown error.

Ok, next thing, the only thing left, really, was factory reset via iTunes, I entered all the Apple ID and unlock pin credentials, and it was done.

**Phone is now factory clean. And it works 100% fine. But it is empty :(**

\*\*\* She DOES NOT have: \*\*\*

**1) any iTunes backups**

**2) iCloud or other cloud backups (iCloud was off)**

**Is there a \*\*\*beeping\*\*\* way to recover some photos and videos from her phone?**

AppStore is useless (US country), when I enter ""**photo recovery**"" in search, I get the whole crap apps in there. I'm all Android, at least we have **DiskDigger** and tons of other options (in particular, if we have external memory card storage).

Any, and I really mean, any app for Windows that advertises like crazy on Google for iPhone recovery is useless, since they either find no photos at all, just calendar and similar things (unimportant) or require **iTunes/iCloud backup** something. I have tried at least 10 of them, and traditional apps like Recuva and alike do not see iPhone as a storage device, since it's mounted like a media something crap (MTP device).

Sorry for the long post, but my Saturday is ruined anyway, and is there any way that really works?

I got an idea to use **iExplorer** to mount it as a **FAT32 Windows drive**, and it was like hell hard to find a matching iTunes version that will work with iExplorer properly, but it was a no go, either. Software like **Recuva** complained about unrecognized file system, and **Stellar Phoenix** *something* successfully scanned it (in like 5-6 minutes, which was odd), but didn't find a thing. It's a virtual device driver that goes through iTunes, so it was a long shot anyway, but still... pity.

I can run a **Linux Ubuntu** disk, but not sure how the device is going to be mounted there and what recovery apps options are available. Does anyone have any idea in this regard?

Any idea?

First let me give you the details,

It’s an iPhone X, not sure on the firmware. I think it was 13.3. I bought it from my friend second hand for her but there weren’t any issues other than the back glass being smashed. Haven’t had any other issues with the phone until today. Hasn’t been dropped, no water damage and haven’t tried to update it and anything happen midway through so I’m at a loss to the problem. 

My girlfriend woke up this morning to her phone not turning on after being on charge overnight. I have tried the hard reset as well as recovery mode and dfu mode but her mac doesn’t recognise the phone when it is plugged in but it recognises mine so the problem lies with the phone not anything else. 

When plugging into the wall to charge it gives the battery charging indication and then starts to boot up with the Apple logo but won’t go past that. It will sit on this screen forever.

Basically I’m just wondering if anyone experienced this or has any advice of what to do next. 

I spoke to Apple support but they only told me everything I already knew then gave me a quote of £600+ to fix it which is ridiculous when I only paid £100 for the phone. 

If there is nothing I can do then she’ll just get a new phone but if it’s possible to fix it I wanna give it a go.

I had an iPhone 5 for years (I loved that thing), but my friend was upgrading and offered me her old iPhone 7. My sister, who had just upgraded herself and changed the SIM cards, offered to change my SIM cards as well, and I accepted.

Everything seemed fine, including music. And then I tried to make a phone call. No sound, and the speaker button is dimmed. FaceTime connects, but as soon as I see the person on the other end, it says it failed. I tried recording a video and when I tried to play it back, I couldn’t hear anything. This is true for the iphone camera and also Snapchat. I also tried to record a voice memo and it doesn’t even let me try.

305,iOS / iPhone Xs file sharing limitations?,gx4juz,2020-06-05 13:27:25," 

Hi,

I recently purchased a iPhone Xs after owning an Android phone for several years.

It's been a long time since I last owned an iOS phone and I forgot that unlike Android, iOS has a lot of limitations on what files you can access on the phone.

I am currently using iTunes and the File Sharing option to try to access files and while I can see a list of file sharing apps as well as the root directory for each file sharing app...I am not able to drill down and open any of the folders/sub directories to add or copy files inside of the folders.

I can however add or copy files and folders on the root level.

Why does Apple allow access to the root directory for each file sharing app to add or copy files or folders but then restricts us from opening the folders in order to add or copy files inside of the folders?

Kind regards,

Drew",,1,1.0

I’ve tried the camera when my phone was both locked and opened & in other camera apps like Snapchat. My selfie camera does show images and I can take a picture most of the time like that, but it often will take a few pictures, freeze up the frame and then “refresh” itself but the pictures are gone.

\-Iphone 7, 128gig,  running IOS 13.5 (up to date)

First I should address I am aware of the bug causing the ""cellular update failed"" on some iPhone 7's specifically. Makes the phone think it has no service etc. I know you can (or could?) return to Apple for a fix.

My original iPhone 7 (which I had for many years) NEVER had this problem. I just had dropped it, broken the camera, drained the battery, etc and it was time to replace. I'm broke AF at the moment and wanted to go for a cheaper refurb option. So I got the same iPhone 7 with the same specs but refurbished from BestBuy. One day in had this problem. Returned it - bought another one from Amazon. Again, it had this problem but except this time on and off sometimes for days at a time. 

THE QUESTION IS: is there any world where two separate model# iPhone 7's have this issue - or could this be a problem with my AT&T account or my sim card (the only common denominator between the 3 phones). I know a refurb is a sketchy option but I just don't want to spend the cash on a new phone - especially if this can be fixed. Again, the original iPhone7 with the same sim card NEVER had this problem.

I’m essentially wondering how much value I could get out of my current phone if I were to trade it in. It’s in very good condition like I said. Would they give me a straight swap for the new SE? Would I have to pay 100 bucks or so? More than that? 

Like I also mentioned, the SE original is about 150 online. Would it be a mistake (from a financial standpoint) to try and sell my current phone and buy the original SE? I’m trying to get as much value out of this as I can.

This post might be a bit jumbled but if someone could decipher and potentially give me some advice that would be much appreciated.

Then the next day the vibrations were gone completely.  So I ordered a replacement Taptic Engine part and replaced that, and it still isn’t working.  

Anyone have any ideas?  

Additional info:  

When I first finished the battery replacement I realized the ribbon cable that connects the charger port and microphone were unplugged.  I plugged them back in and the phone was boot looping.  I then realized that when that ribbon cable was unplugged I could boot the phone all the way up, but obviously the phone wouldn’t charge and I’d have no microphone.  I then found a happy medium where I’d plug the ribbon cable in, but only gently and then I’d have a working phone, until the Taptic Engine went out the next day.   

Is the microphone/charger port that connects to the main board in any way related to the Taptic Engine?  I’m wondering if there’s some damage to the ribbon cable connection that is causing all the problems...?  I’m tempted to open my phone back up to mess with that one ribbon cable that was causing the boot loop issues to see if I get anything at all out of the Taptic Engine.

**Phone Model:** iPhone SE

**Purchase date:** within the last two weeks; my family ordered them as a group

**Country:** United States

**Nature of purchase:** personal use

**OS:** not sure, probably the most recent one

**The issue:**

I recently switched to iPhone from Android, and did not have an Apple ID until today.  I created one and linked it to my email, but have not been able to link it to my phone number.

iOS appears to have created a Catch-22, where I can't send or receive texts through iMessage, or receive calls on the call function, because I haven't activated my phone number on Apple ID; and I can't activate my Apple ID because doing so requires me to receive either a text message or a call on this phone.

**What caused the issue:**
It just came this way.

**Attempted solutions:**
I've tried sending a text message to myself (it failed to send), and I've checked my email and spam folder for iMessages I could have received (none found), since one of the settings says I can receive iMessages there too.

I also tried turning off iMessage in the Messages settings.  This still hasn't allowed me to send messages to myself, which makes me think there might be some kind of problem with my phone number not being attached to this phone.

385,Block a specific group text,gustwt,2020-06-01 20:55:21,"Just wondering if there is a way to block a SPECIFIC group text thread I’m apart of.

Been apart of this group text for a few years now with around 7 guys on it.  When it started, I was fine with everything and everyone on it.  Eventually got tired of getting so many messages so I turned of the alerts for JUST this text thread.  Also after a while didn’t remain friends with 2 of the participants so naturally I blocked those people specifically but still get this continuing conversation where I get replies from the people I still DO talk to without any context since they’re replying to the blocked ones.

Don’t want to have to have some line-in-the-sand declarative statement to all of them on the thread where I say “hey, I don’t want to be apart of this group text anymore because you guys reply way too much and also I don’t want to hear from Josh or Will anymore so can you guys just take me off of this” but I’m not sure what else there is to do.  As soon as I do that I’ll start getting nothing but resentment from the guys I still communicate with.

Just want a way to block ONLY this group text and not the people that I still talk to.

iPhone 8
13.3.1
2017 sometime, Canada
No warranty 



Problem:

• for the past week and a bit, I’ve frequently had calls on my phone and discord cut in and out or sound distant from either end, interchangeably. My battery also, seems to be draining quicker. (My battery is at 88% the capacity as when store purchased)


Replicating:

Making a call or receiving a call by phone or calling app. 
Battery obviously drains itself. (It can be sitting and drain around %5+ within half an hour.)


What I’ve tried:

Sliding the sounds bar up and down, silent mode off, turning off many background apps refreshing, deleting some apps. Problem persists. 


Possible causes:

3 months ago, I purchased some cheap ear buds to use and they seemed to permanently mess up the way it reacts to headphones. It will trigger Siri when putting apple headphones in and it will rapid cycle through music or pause and play as if possessed etc. I no longer use headphones with it. 

Other notes:

As I type this, I noticed when an alarm came on, it displayed the volume button as if I were altering it from the external buttons. 

Body of phone is not hot; app battery consumption looks like what I’d assume it to be. 

I hear back and forths as to whether or not iPhone can contract malware. I use an ad blocker and try my best to stay away from any site I’m unsure of. I regularly clean the safari cache and monitor my network. 

Not trying to come across as paranoid, just not sure 100% what to attribute it to. I’m pretty opposed to factory resetting but if it’s the only solution, I accept that. But I’d love any other suggestions.

My Iphone 11 pro has been having an issue over calls/facetime/zoom recently. 

Whether I am on wifi or calling over network, and regardless whether it's a regular call, facetime video/audio, or even zoom, the people I am on the call with will hear my audio cutting out. This happens quite frequently, and happens in the middle of speaking. I cannot figure it out. The phone is up to date, it's been restarted, etc, but there has been nothing to improve this.

The fact that it happens regardless of network/application makes me think it's a phone hardware issue; however, if the mic was bad or something I would just assume my outgoing audio wouldn't work at all.

I want to buy a new phone but there’s seriously so many options and I really don’t know what to go for. I intend to watch some videos and do some research myself but if anybody could point me in a direction. I could afford a grand for one like the 11 pro, but it would be quite expensive for me if that makes sense. Not rich at all. I don’t need much ‘ power’ or anything, I’m not a photographer, or a music producer or any of that. I just call, text, social media, play games, listen to music and watch netflix on my phone.

So in that sense is there any point in getting say an 11 pro over an 11, or even that over an X?

What’s the difference between the X, XR and XS as well?

I would normally assume more expensive is better but they’re all similarly priced as well. As you can see I am very confused and any help would be much appreciated haha

Is it possible to factory reset an iphone 8 with no possible icloud access?  We were in the process of migrating an elderly (80s) friend from an iphone 5 to an 8.  Cox took the liberty of deleting her email account since she did not use it for 6 months.

Now the 8 is stuck on wanting to validate an iCloud account that we do not have the password for and cannot retrieve it.  The 8 will not nuke itself back to the initial out-of-box hello screen setup assistant without taking care of the icloud issue (unless I am unaware of the correct process. Volume keys then lock key reboot does not work).  We set her up a new icloud bound to gmail, airdropped her pictures to an ipad on that account, and now we want to nuke the iphone 8 fresh and put it on the new gmail icloud and then destroy/discard the 5.

I'm aware that I took a massive step back as far as hardware goes, but I still feel like the baseline experience is lackluster and I'm really frustrated. I have a suspicion that hardware isn't the source of my issues and it's more of an iOS problem. Hopefully you can fill me in.

My first complaint is the notifications. I miss shit all the time. It seems like if I don't see a text as it comes in I lose it to the ether. Android has persistent icons in the top bar to indicate notifications. As far as I can tell the only equivalent in iOS is the badges on icons. Am I missing something important?

The second and definitely most annoying is the keyboard. I can't type worth a damn on this thing. It autocorrects words for seemingly no reason. I've tried using gboard to help the transition but it seems to be suffering from the same issue. Is there an OS level problem here? Am I just used to nicer screens?

Almost everyone else in my life is on iPhone so I would like to try to make it work. I'm not opposed to shelling out for a new phone if it will solve my issues. I just saw the free phone as a great chance to try it out.

549,Calendar/contacts disappeared - any way to recover?,gov91x,2020-05-23 00:27:54,"All, thanks in advance for any help;

I’ve got an iPhone 6 with 12.4.4. Purchased in 2014 in the US for personal use. 

As of like midnight last night, everything was fine. When I woke up this morning my calendar (I use the Apple default app) was gone and so were almost all of my contacts. 

Things I’ve looked at:

I am still signed in on the iPhone. 

I checked and all the calendars are clicked to show in the app - just now only the holidays have anything. (The other options besides Holidays are Work and Home; not sure what I used before but it was just whatever the default was.)
Checked iCloud, only to discover that my phone wasn’t backing up to iCloud :(

—-

Things I have not done:

Signed out and back in to my phone (don’t want to lose my safari tabs and I don’t know if they’re part of the backup I did earlier today or if signing out will lost them; concerned that logging out &amp; in will “lock in” the problem). 

There is also my concern that signing out will apparently delete, like everything? I can restore from a backup, but won’t that just leave me in the position I’m in?

Updated to the newest iOS (also concerned that updating will “lock in” the problem)

Restored from iCloud (apparently my phone hasn’t been backing up to iCloud; yay)

—-

Things I’m not sure about:

My most recent backup was from 2/1 - is there any way to restore just the calendar and contacts from that backup, or is it an all or nothing thing?

Thanks again!

ETA: Since this happened, I just tried to add something to my calendar and noticed that it picks “Work” as default. I’m all but positive that wasn’t the case before. Was there something other than “Work” or “Home” that I could have been adding to? The phone also logged me out of Twitter but not any other app I’ve noticed.",,1,1.0

563,iPhone X - Caught in a boot loop.,go74ii,2020-05-21 22:46:42," 

My iPhone X is currently caught in a boot loop. I bought it off a friend the other day who told me it was caught in the loop, but I bought it hoping to fix it.

I tried restoring it in both regular restore mode, and even DFU mode but I got the same result both times.

What happens is, it after I run the restores, they appear to complete like normal. When I try to start the phone, or it attempts to boot afterwords, then it shows the apple logo for a few moments; from there it quickly shows an image of the apple logo + the loading bar graphic, then instantly shuts off / restarts after showing a minimal amount of progress on the loading bar.

Yesterday, when I was getting out of the car, the phone fell out of my lap and hit the ground softly in its case, and did no damage to the phone, but it then randomly booted up properly and allowed me to setup the phone.

Today, the phone died and now its caught in the same boot loop as before. Any ideas? I've tried smacking it around a bit but no luck so far. I'm also currently trying to restore it again. I'm looking for any possible temporary / permanent (ideally) solutions. Thank you very much!",,2,1.0

What is highly inconvenient is that even while powered down, when the phone receives input that the top button is being pressed, the screen flashes on with the apple logo on for \~5 seconds/off \~5 seconds. This drains the battery pretty quickly even though it's powered down.

Is there any way to stop this from happening? I'd hate to have to keep it charging every moment it isn't in use or else have the battery sit idle, totally drained.",,2,1.0

597,iPhone not sending audio during phone calls,gn2tst,2020-05-20 02:22:59,"Hi everyone, first time here so any help is appreciated. Here's hoping I give you all the info you need on the first go.

- iPhone model and iOS version

iPhone 8 64GB Grey, iOS 13.4.1

- Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

I'm almost certain the phone is no longer under warranty, and if the problem is so dire that it would require repair/replacement beyond what I am able to do myself, I'll just buy a new one. So I wouldn't dwell on this.

- What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

The issue is as follows; when using the Phone app to make a call, I can hear whoever I am calling just fine, but they are unable to hear me. They are able to hear me when I plug in headphones, or use the speaker phone, but not when I hold the phone to my ear. The problem started yesterday and has been replicated on every call I've made since, regardless of the app used. (e.g. Facebook Messenger).

- What caused the issue?

Unknown.

- What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

I have tested the microphone in the voice memo's app and it picks up sound fine. I reset the network settings on the phone as well as the general settings. I did a soft reset on the phone. I've turned off Bluetooth. I have cleaned the lightning port to the best of my ability. I have turned off noise canceling in accessibility.

- Any other information you think might be useful.

The problem seemed to spring up out of no where. I haven't made any software updates or anything that might have acted as a catalyst I don't think. The strangest thing to me is that the headphones and speaker phone will both transmit audio, but not the standard mic. Furthermore, it's strange to me that the standard mic can detect sound in the voice memos app, but will not send it out over any kind of call.

Thanks very much, any help is appreciated. I'll be monitoring this closely and trying anything suggested.

UPDATE: I'm still testing things. When I rub my thumb over the bottom microphone in a call, the person on the other end can hear it.",,2,1.0

639,iPhone 8 [13.1.1] : Messages defaulting to iMessage for Android SMS recipient.,glg4x1,2020-05-17 14:18:47,"Thanks in advance for anyone that can help.

The recipient has a Mac with usage of the iMessage platform and an Android phone.
The messages tend to default to iMessage despite the selected phone number being Android.

If I have sent an iMessage to the recipient earlier in the day and then I want to send a text message, even though I select the mobile number (rather than the associated iMessage email address) it defaults to blue text in the ‘To’ section.

Even if I go ‘new message’ and type in the Android phone number manually, it still defaults to blue. Copy and pasting makes no difference either. 

If I hard press and ‘forward’ the message after it defaults to iMessage, it’s usually the same issue. I don’t think I’ve seen a ‘send as SMS’ option pop up. 

If I go to the contacts and find the person, go ‘message’ and then ‘mobile’ or select their number, it will still set the ‘To’ text to blue/iMessage.

Even if they SMS me, and I try to reply straight back, it will tend to default to whatever I had used to message THEM last, and if it’s an iMessage to their Mac, it almost creates a cycle. I hope that makes sense?

It’s been doing this for some time, and is variable/intermittent with no pattern, despite undertaking the last few iOS update, restarting the phone, restating the messages app and turning iMessages on and off. 

Is anyone else struggling with this? I suppose it’s probably something technical, but it can be really irritating if you’re trying to contact someone with something important and they don’t see the message straight away, because it will be sitting in their email inbox instead, if their Mac isn’t open!

Side note: I feel like I can still select numbers fine through my Mac, so I hope it’s not some weird communication issue between my iPhone and Mac. I have got messages synced with iCloud too, if that would be make any difference to the issue.

644,Old Imaginary Apple ID included in iCloud Backup,gl82zq,2020-05-17 03:06:54,"So we just went through the broken screen song and dance. It doesn't respond to anything, so we can't even link the phone to a Computer (The last computer we linked the old phone to was broken down into it's component pieces with the HD was wiped ages ago. -.-) to salvage the ripped CDs on it. Which is worse because the Backup HD for those rips is ALSO dead (Protect your Tech when you Move Folks!). So we cried at our losses and purchased a ""New to us"" iPhone. Thankfully no drama there, and we were able to restore our backup Almost no problem.

In the course of restoring the backup, it mentions something about ""Some Content"" being attached to a seperate Apple ID and it asks for the password to that ID. The E-Mail displayed has never ""Intentionally"" been used for anything Apple Related, as it is not a real E-Mail. It looks like some kind of perversion of an E-Mail address someone might imagine they had based on their existing E-Mails, and they remember having some E-Mail related headache related to the old iPhone back when they first bought it and took it to an Apple ""Genius"", but nothing ever seemed to come of it.

We tried to reset the password for it, but of course, they want to send an E-Mail to the imaginary E-Mail Address... which won't work for obvious reasons. -.-

I would post a video if I could so please bear with me as I try to explain the issues of the screen.

It is perfectly normal when first booting up the iphone, no issues. However, after a minute or so the bottom 1/3^rd of the screen begins so flicker, brighter. Not much noticable but only so slightly. More so from the bottom of the screen, easing up as it reaches 1/3 up the screen. 

After seconds, the flickering then turns from a ""brightness flickering"" to copy the display from the top of the screen.  For example, it will display (in a flickering pattern) everything from the time, notifications, charge, anything that is shown at the top will flicker at the bottom.

I recently bought a Samsung Fit e fitness band. I downloaded the Samsung Health app and paired it with the Fit e. The thing is, I desperately need the Samsung Health and Apple Health apps to sync with one another on the heart rate and step counter data. The reason being that my health insurer app will only allow the Apple Health app to give it data. And that is the whole reason I bought the Fit e, for the health insurance app. That app is willing to connect with Apple Health app, Fitbit app, Huawei app, Garmin app and a bunch of other. Just not the Samsung health app for some reason.

But for some reason, Apple Health will only use iPhone as a source of data and not the Fit e band or the Samsung Health app. I can only give permission for the Samsung Health app to read data from Apple Health and not write as well.

So yeah, I am hoping someone here can tell if there is a way to get the Fit e/Samsung Health app as a source of data in Apple Health app. Thanks in advance.",,6,1.0

Today I pulled up safari and went to type in a web address that began with the letter “S.”  The keyboard froze and so did safari. No big, kill the app and reopen. It’s still stuck on the same page. Kill it a second time and relaunch. It reverts back to the last page I was on. Go to type in the address again and it locks up. Every time I type in “S” as the starting letter it locks and I have to close and open, close and open. 

Did the simple stuff like reboot the phone, and went into web data and started deleting any sites starting with “S” that had any actual data next to it (as opposed to 0.0mb). 

I can type every other letter of the alphabet except for “S”. I’m not sure when this started because the last few days I’ve most stuck to my favorites. 

I’m sure the simplest answer is to clear history and web data. But I’d like to avoid that. 

I can, however, start with “www.s” and get to the site. Also, I’ve got no issues starting with S in my Firefox browser. 

I’m totally perplexed by this. Like I said, clearing all history and web data is the obvious place to start but I’d like to avoid that.

My last backup was from about a year ago on my old phone.

My 11's memory was full and I've been backing up videos slowly to dropbox. I was trying to delete stuff to clear out the memory yesterday morning but it wasn't responding so I tried to restart it, this sent it into a boot loop. Tried all the tricks to get it out but it would only stop while I was holding the power button after force restart (spent all day doing this).

A message came up on the screen to connect to a computer and gave the link to [support.apple](https://support.apple). something or other so I followed it. Went to itunes and it said it would download the latest ios and try to fix it, but that if that didn't work I would need to do a factory reset, clicked okay and it went straight into a factory reset but I didn't realise what it was doing (it said it was 'restoring' and my stupid ass thought it was restoring ios).

In a panic I set it to load the last backup I had which turned out to be the one from over a year ago.

Is there anything I can do to recover my original files?

I'm willing to do pretty much anything at this point. Illegal, costly, whatever, I don't care. This thing had pictures of my dead grandmother, lost pets, people and pets I'm stuck 300 miles away from in this lockdown.

748,iPhone 11 - the most problematic phone I’ve ever had..,gh2o93,2020-05-10 14:41:33,"iPhone 11 iOS 13.4.1  UK


 I’m pretty sure this is just MY luck.. however I’ve had the iPhone 11 for the best part of 2 weeks and have had nothing but issues with it. 
I’ve tried to contact Apple support but with everything going on the options are limited and I can’t seem to find anything on how to solve my issues. 

So please if you have any suggestions! 

Current issues are:

Charging very slowly, the charging port also doesn’t stay connected as in it’s always in but goes on and off charge. This has only recently happened - it was great when I bought it. 

I also sometimes get messages saying “this accessory isn’t supported” - I am using the original cable that comes with the iPhone - I have tried others and the problem is still there. 

Same when it’s connected to a computer and I tried to download my pictures off the phone to my PC - it kept disconnecting and if it was connected I’d get an error half way through the download saying “ device unresponsive”.

Lastly I have a constant message on my iPhone saying “update Apple ID Settings - some account services will not be available until you sign in again” but I am already signed in? And when I type in my password again it just loads the page saying “updating iCloud” for hours and never does anything. 

Any advice please! Thank you all",,3,1.0
749,Spotify control goes away from audio control,gh2ep8,2020-05-10 14:25:51,"Hey all, new here but have been having this issue for about a year and haven't been able to find any solutions. I just got a new phone (the new SE) which I was hopeful would fix the issue but unfortunately it did not...

&#x200B;

Basically, you have the built in audio controls (in the control center, lock screen, or using buttons on headphones). Tehse all work fine, but for some reason when i'm listening to music in spotify (which is 99% of the time), those controls will sometimes just go away. So then I have to open the app to pause, skip songs, restart music if I stopped to watch a video, etc. It's obviously a relatively minor inconvenience but I'd love to get any ideas if people have them for why this is happening and what I can do to avoid it!

756,XS spazzing out and twitching like its being touched a lot,ggqv16,2020-05-10 00:07:18," 

**1. iPhone model and iOS version**

*XS on 13.3.1*

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

USA on the date it was released from best buy for personal use

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

I noticed trying to back out of an app in the top left of the screen it wasn't registering touch. then it just started spazzing out like i was scrolling or touching everywhere. It eventually chilled out after sleeping it and waking it. But every couple of minutes it tweaks out again really crazy. when I try to text someone it scrolls up in their convo up and up. Someone sent me a message on IG and just trying to unlock the phone it opened the message and then started typing random shit and emojis. 

**4. What caused the issue?**

seemingly nothing. I have not dropped it or got water on it. It pretty much just sits on my couch next to me during all this. I live alone so its not like I have a kid that messed with it and isn't telling me. 

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

I cleaned off the screen. then tried holding side button to turn off, which was hard because the upper area of the screen doesn't always sense touch so I couldn't swipe it to turn off. then I did the vol up vol down side button hold to reboot. 

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

Over a year ago I cracked the screen and got it replaced at a third party repair place called UBREAKWEFIX or something. It was fine except when I put it on the wireless charger it would do this same ghost touching twitch thing but I brought it back to them and they said it may have been a shit digitizer. they replaced it and everything has been good since then.

I was literally just using the mail app - which I use around ten times a day - and i didn’t even close it down when switching to another app, and thats when it happened. I jumped back to the homescreen, everything was fine, I swiped right to another set of apps and swiped back (habit) and my iPhone suddenly decided that I don’t need the mail app which is one of my most used apps, and starts to offload it while it was still open in the background. What the fuck?! Not only that, but it also started offloading the calculator app and the contacts app, both of which i also use a lot and both of which could be essential in an emergency.

None of those apps take up much space and yet I still have a selection of games that I havent touched in months and take up gigabytes of data that haven’t been offloaded ever.

I’m a student and recently got the new SE after saving up for a while and I absolutely love it so far. The only problem I’ve been having (and it seems to be a common problem) is that all the screen protectors that I’ve bought and tried that say they will fit the iPhone 8 / new SE leave huge air bubbles along the sides of the phone. I’m guessing that the SE screen must be more curved than the 8? Either way, it’s a really annoying problem and I can’t bear to use a protector with the big bubbles on the sides. 

I’m wondering whether I should just give up and not bother with a screen protector, or whether I should just keep trying different protectors until I find one that fits. Has anyone managed to find one so far that doesn’t leave these air bubbles? If not, would it be reasonably safe to just put a bumper case on the phone and keep it in a phone pouch or sock or something when putting it in my bag? I am worried about breaking the screen since like I said, I’m a student and funds are tight.

Both iCloud and phone storage were full so she deleted apps etc photos but after this happened the storage never updated but the apps are gone and then photos would say they are deleted by then re appear shortly after. Her photos take up the most space but no where near the 25gb she could use the cloud to store them in.

Another issue that old photos become blurry and cant be viewed properly. Why is this?I've tried to point her to a few things but havent been able to resolve it. Some apps started to show a cloud with an arrow i think next to them before they were 'deleted'.

Playing music on the iphone SE does not produce any sound anywhere. 

Who here has done this before, or can offer some ideas?

811,Help with corrupt videos (sound but picture is just a static grey screen),geseyi,2020-05-06 20:57:14,"Hello,  

I recorded a few videos on my iPhone - they were in landscape orientation, and recorded with the front (selfie) camera.  The videos seemed to record fine - the record button showed that a video was being made, and I could see the video on the iPhone's screen as it recorded.  But then, when I navigated to the video on my iPhone, it was just sound and a static grey screen (no picture).  I've tried to open it in photos and a variety of Mac apps (like VLC and Handbrake), but either I only get audio with no picture or some variation of an error message that the file can't be opened.  

&#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced this?  Once I noticed the videos seemed to be corrupt, I recreated the error a few times - videos shot in landscape on the front camera turned out this way, while shot with the back cameras or in portrait mode worked fine.  This isn't alwasy the case, though - sometimes I am able to record playable videos with the front camera in landscape mode.  (I just provide this info in case it's helpful.  I'm happy to record using the back camera going forward, but I would like to be able to get these existing corupted videos to play.)

833,(HELP) Need to Take Low Res Photos,gdsqyi,2020-05-05 06:46:24,"Hi there!

So for work I take tons and tons of photos everyday (500-1000), and my company has a cloud where I upload them, but in order to conserve space I need them to be small files. They prefer 640x480. 

Obviously iPhone natively takes high resolution photos, and aside from changing the photo “compatibility” settings and the video resolution, I haven’t been able to find a way to take 640x480 pics with the camera. 

My last work phone was an android and I had an app that would let me take 640x480 pics, but I haven’t had any luck finding an app like this for iPhone. 

Right now I’m stuck using Microsoft picture manager to resize them after plugging into my computer after a long day of work and doing it manually. It’s a huge pain in the ass, and would save me so much time if I could make them low resolution right from my iPhone, and upload them on the spot using my data. 

Does anybody know of any apps or hidden settings that can help with this?

All input is much appreciated.

I'm an android user so please bear with me if my knowledge seems stupid. I haven't had an iPhone since the 4 (briefly with the 7 but never plugged it into a PC). My wife has 10'000's of photos and I'd like to put what I can on my PC and eventually into the cloud. I'd do this directly to google cloud but I don't want it running in the background all day, I can schedule this on my PC run in the small hours of the night (bandwidth isn't amazing so i don't want it ruining our internet during the day).

1. It's my understand that iCloud and her phone are fully synced and I cannot have stuff in the cloud but not of the phone?  
If this is the case my aim here is to add them to my google drive, as I believe she can download google photos and view things on her phone and it seems there's workaround to have it delete photos from the phone but not the cloud.
2. First thing I did was plug it into my PC and from memory. It worked like a USB stick for photos. I was simply going to copy and paste them.  
It's only showing me a handful of photos in a handful of folders. 103APPLE, 105APPLE...107,1108 111,117,121,125 and 126. Some are empty, some have a single photo in them and the last one has about 20.   
I tried using photos as per apple's instructions but just see's the above photos.   

3. I previously set up iCloud on my PC to sync with a folder on my PC. It's hasn't synced since January (I know it's been on as I've seen it running on several occasions. 
4. Iit's on now and not doing everything). I ran it not long ago and it's downloading 26,000 items. I suspect I'm getting more duplicate copies of photos. I had previously seen it up to date. It was easy to set up on my C drive but a pain in the ass (and I work in IT) to set up on a secondary drive. Ideally, I don't use iCloud as it's a hunk of shit and I've tried to use it several times over the years and is by far the most troublesome program I've ever had to deal with (and I have many clients that use all sorts of weird and wonderful programs).

When this issue occurs the app that my phone is stuck on remains fully functional, and I still receive notifications from other apps and can view them from the pull-down menu.

I still get banners, badges, and even the lock screen icon bar. Notifications for all other apps work normally almost all the time.

**What I've Tried:** I have tried everything I can think of including: changing all notifications settings, hard restarts/shutdowns, updating the phone (this happened before 13.4.1), simply changing sounds and vibration patterns, covering/uncovering the light sensor (I don't know why I thought this would change anything), etc. Nothing has changed the problem.

**What Causes the Issue:** The only thing I can identify that causes the issue is locking the phone screen. I haven't found anything else that causes the issue.

What could possible be causing this issue? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. It has become quite annoying missing messages for an extended amount of time, especially incase of important information. Thanks everyone!",,3,1.0

851,HEIC images taken on iPhone X are larger than Apple's Image Capture exports,gcvtr1,2020-05-03 18:45:26,"TL;DR: Image Capture on the Mac is exporting HEIC images smaller than they were stored on the iPhone. Am I losing photo quality here and if so how do I transfer my iPhone's photos exactly as they are saved on the device?

Full Details: 

To make use of all the time we've got right now as a result of the quarantine, I've been collecting all my photos from various different devices over the years and storing them in one location ready to upload to the cloud.  

Although I had my fair share of issues with some Android phones, trying to get the photos off my iPhone X onto a Windows PC has been nothing short of a nightmare. I won't go into it too much here but I want to upload these photos into the cloud as JPG's not HEIC's, however, iOS's automatic conversion feature does not work at all and crashes everytime I try to move the folders over. I also get the same result when I turn on the 'Keep Originals' option. 

After much frustration, I've decided to use the Image Capture application on my Macbook Air to just move the entire library over to a USB as HEIC's. Then I'll find a good converter to change them into JPG's. When I compare the exported file on my USB to the exif data of the exact same photo on my iPhone X though, I'm noticing massive size differences. Often entire megabytes... 

I want these transferred photos to be the same quality as they are on the phone itself. That's why I haven't used any 3rd party transfer tools, to avoid a loss in quality. Image Capture seems to be doing this anyway though. 

Does anybody understand why Image Capture is exporting my photos at a drastically lower size than the originals and how I can get around this at all? Any suggestions or ideas would be much appreciated!",,2,1.0

I have a problem that I couldn't find any thread about. I just replaced my battery in my iPhone XS Max, and I'm noticing that the charge is very slow. I used to charge my old battery pretty quickly. It's been an hour and I'm only up to 40% charge and I'm using an iPad fast charger that I've had for years.  
The company that did my phone says it's a genuine battery, but the phone shows the ""Not Genuine"" error message that happens when you don't use the official Apple tech support to replace the battery. Could this maybe be the problem?

Issue: last 2-3 weeks phone has become very sluggish. Lagging with typing and screen commands. Some apps open and crash immediately. 
Latest iOS 
When phone is power cycled it works normally for a bit then begins to go downhill. 

Erased and restored from backup. Resolved issue for a couple days then issue returned. 

AppleCare said it is the battery that needs replacing and that it is what is causing the issues. No other issues popped up. 

Is it true that the battery can be causing it, or is that just what the tech said because they couldn’t resolve the problem?

907,My iPhone 6 died,gawz8h,2020-04-30 14:45:45," I have an iPhone 6 (don’t know the iOS). It currently has no warranty.

My phone died yesterday.

For about two months I’ve been using for about half of the time an extension cord from which the charger would come out and disconnect easily / wouldn’t sit firmly. For about 2-3 weeks the phone started having problems with charging. I would plug the phone and it wouldn’t start charging unless I would:

\-unplug it and plug it back in, but turned 180 degrees

\-unplug it and plug it back in a lot of times

\-leave it plugged for a longer period of time

(none of the things above were a definite solution, usually 1 of the 3 would work, but I never knew which)

Yesterday I let it charge like usual in that extension cord (I think the battery was about 40%) and found it dead 20 mins later. The phone wasn’t dropped or hit or anything.

I cleaned the charging port (although there was nothing there). I long pressed the home and the lock button. I plugged it into the laptop. I let it charge for a longer period of time. I bought a new cable and did all of the above.

The screen shows nothing.

I also wanted to check the charging port connector and disconnect and reconnect the battery connector, like in this video ([https://youtu.be/gvTgzugSpiM?t=257](https://youtu.be/gvTgzugSpiM?t=257)), but I didn’t find small enough screwdrivers to unscrew those 2 tiny screws.",,1,0.67

I have an iPhone X that fell from a kitchen counter to the ground this morning and now the Face ID, front camera, rear camera, and flash/flashlight don't work (both in the camera app and third-party camera apps). The screen just stays all black. I had some light cracks on the back from prior drops but no new cracks after this most recent one. I tried restarting, updating to iOS 13.4.1, reset all settings, force restarting, taking the SIM out and putting it back in again, and checking for water damage (just in case) inside the SIM card slot.

The phone was purchased in mid-May last year off of eBay for personal use. There was only a three month warranty on the phone so it has expired now.

Based on everything I've seen online it seems like it may be a hardware issue. Are there any other suggestions for troubleshooting before I look into repair options? Does repair even seem like a reasonable option at this point or is there likely to be more internal damage?

I’ve been an iPhone user for over 5 years, currently with my XS.

I suspect that part of the issue is with a bad repair job. I had the screen replaced about a year ago. The home button has never worked right since then, it’s depressed and only works for fingerprint ID, which means I can’t hold it down along with the power button to reset.

I went ahead and removed the screen and found that when it separated, it disconnected the LCD ribbons, so I reconnected those and closed it back up. However it still won’t turn on.

960,Android guy looking to possibly try out IPHONE. Help!!!,g9a0ko,2020-04-27 21:36:08," 

Hey guys I'm an android guy for sure. But I might take a chance (won't sound like much of a big leap) but I'm thinking about trying out an iphone. But only a very cheap / older Iphone. Almost as a test or sampling how iphones work. Can anyone suggest what Iphone I should get? I keep hearing mostly iphone 5 or 6,6s or even possibly the 7?

My only requirements are that it must be in the $50 to $90 range (I would be buying it from amazon, or craigslist or something used for sure.) Also I want it to have solid battery life (which I love about iphones) and needs to be able to handle apps well. Thinks like facebook live, or cam streaming sites, skype type of apps. Thanks in advance.",,0,0.5

964,11 Pro Battery Help,g95h88,2020-04-27 17:43:14,"I'm actually asking for my father, who's in California (I'm in NYC) so I can't help him directly. He's been having super fast battery drain and trying everything that he can to deal with it (factory resetting, turning off bluetooth/data/FaceID/etc.) and tracking battery usage to see what the culprit is.

He'll be down to 70% in \~3 hours without using any of the above services and some light texting/a phone call. 

Apple sent him a new phone, same issue arising. I'm wondering if there are some apps that can drain battery \*without\* being noticed by the Battery Usage Monitor? 

I'm suggesting that he factory reset and then manually reinstall apps, 1-by-1, though I feel bad that he's having to do that.

968,"AppleID problems, can you remove it without involving apple directly as they are as useful as a chocolate teapot",g8v7lf,2020-04-27 06:28:43,"So I personally use Android phones for everything, however my wife is a fan of apples products, she uses the XR but we have her old phones such as the 7 and the iphone 5.   


The iPhone 7 is setup with her current apple ID however the iphone 5 was attached to an old ID that is now defunct, she had the same issue with her Ipad Mini 2 but she got that sorted by apple, because she doesn't use this phone however she just left it how it is and it has sat in a drawer.   


Our kids love to use the phones for education apps, so I was thinking if I can get this phone reset then my daughter can have the apps she likes installed on it, especially whilst we are in lockdown.

I actually have my own account logged into the store part of the phone, but the iCloud account ""is not verified or does not exist"" even when I reset the password via the email address it is linked to.  


Any ideas how I can sort this out myself?

969,Browser stops loading webpages,g8v2m9,2020-04-27 06:17:57,"I have an iPhone 7 and, as far as I’m aware, the iOS is up to date. 

For a while now, my iPhone eventually stops loading webpages on a tab. This happens when I google something and I go back and forth clicking on multiple links (I very rarely go to websites using the address bar, so I’m not sure if it’s just when searching or not). 

The webpages eventually just come up blank, partially load or load the top end of the page (minus the very top) and I become unable to scroll. If I click back, the webpages that previously worked fine now have the same problem. The way I can get around this is by copying and pasting the web address into a new tab and loading it up from there, where the page loads with no issues. 

I’ve tried various fixes: restarting my iPhone; closing all the tabs in the browser down and manually shutting down the app; changing the search engine; downloading and using the Firefox browser app instead of safari. I’ve also had a look at the safari settings but I can’t find any obvious fixes. 

Of course, it’s driving me mad. I wonder if anybody else has experienced this? I’ve tried to search for solutions on google but I just can’t find anything!

(The reason why I her brother is typing this and not my parents is because said parents aren't as tech savvy) She is on it CONSTANTLY. For example, today she spent at least 6 hours on Roblox (shows you her age range) and refuses to get off. I know what everyone is thinking, you should talk about this with her and try to figure something out. I agree somewhat on this and our family has already for a year plus tried to get her to understand/socialize with other people in the house. The reason she was on it so much today was that everyone was occupied with work on our property and not really laying the hammer down. We have already tried the Circle app (Netgear router had it integrated until I upgraded the firmware to DD-Wrt) and the circle sucked big time. It would sometimes not sync properly, and it had a fee monthly, etc. Screen time, that's built into IOS sometimes doesn't work and doesn't have functionality with android.

I started getting the pop up “no storage” so I started to comb through my photos and videos and ended up with only 1200 photos and video on my phone. So at first when I go back to the storage menu it says nothing has changed....so to google I go, I end up resetting the date manually, and see my photos have now dropped to 23gb, only 5 GB, for that many? I mean I guess. But when I look at the main storage tab, I am still at 62.3gb???? So I scroll to the bottom of that menu to see “OTHER” has now gone from 14gb, to 19gb???
