I still wouldn't hold my breath for 5+ year support like on iPhones, but because Google made it easier to make updates, they may give it more years of support then before.

Also, because it's android, even if manufacturers won't make you a new version of Android, community will, and my xiaomi Mi5(2016 phone) works great on pixel experience Android 10 ROM. If you're into that, you may also want to take a look at project Treble.. The flagships will be the first to get updates of course. They tend to do so the December or January after Google releases their version, with the option to get in for the open beta version by October.

The flagships and higher end phones get monthly security updates, and depending on carriers who might choose to skip or give late. The tablets are getting security updates quarterly.

Google also mandates that all units that sold 100k devices get the updates released until 18mos after launch, so most units will get almost 2 years security updates.

For flagships, they get 2 OS updates (so the S20 that got released with Android 10 gets updates to 11 and 12), and security patches for four years (the S7 got its final security update this year)..

The foreground app gets in this pseudo-fullscreen view where swiping left and right switches apps but swiping up to close, is not allowed. It's like some kind of gesture is getting into this dumb state.

Is this caused by Nova Launcher, or am I triggering a native feature of Android?

More critically, how do I disable this from triggering?",1,1.0,7.0,"The task switcher is nothing to do with nova launcher and is part of your system (default) launcher.
When you use a launcher like nova, you are using two launchers at once, your system launcher shows the task switcher, and nova cannot change or interfere with its operations.
Third party launchers can only take control of the task switcher if root is used in conjunction with magisk module called ""quickswitch"" but unfortunately and very conveniently, nova doesn't support that root workaround.
The gestures navigation is what causes the issue mostly, users claim they can get round it by selecting the old three button navbar, but many users are reluctant to do so.

You should also be aware the android 10 / custom launcher combination is not a great combination and won't work properly until Google offers users of custom launchers more support, which may come eventually.

I suggest you visit r/novalauncher or novas official discord channel for a full explanation of the issue, it's very well known, documented and fully explained.
There's unfortunately no fix at this time and the fix won't come untill android 11 is released (according to nova). I imagine you're using Android 10 gestures?

This is a known bug that happens when you use a third party launcher with gestures. They're isn't really anything you can do about it; Google made features tied more closely to your launcher, and that sucks for those of us with third party launchers.

37,Do I have to take my phone to a service for water damage?,hc4j0t,2020-06-19 17:08:35,"My phone is a Xiaomi Redmi 5

To explain exactly, I dropped my phone in some water, basically just the upper part. I took it out quickly, wiped it up and (because I didn't know better) put it in rice overnight. That didn't do anything obviously, so after seeing it wasn't turning on this morning I opened up the back. I wiped the visible water with tissue paper and spent some time drying it with a hair dryer. I then left it open to air dry more for a few hours. When I could see no more condensation anywhere ( like on the lens of the front camera), I tried to turn it on again. 

It turned on fine, but there's an inch or so of water that got in a corner of the display area and it's visible.  I turned it back off, put it on its side on a tissue so the water would have somewhere to possibly come out. 

I asked a phone service out of curiosity if I did the right thing and they just said I should bring it ASAP - now, I don't know if it's cause of course they want to make money or just telling the truth. The cost of cleaning for liquid contact is pretty high and I'm not sure I can afford it right now.  So I'd like a few other opinions before I dish out the money I don't have :(",0,0.5,3.0,"You cant open it up on your own?

Google Drive/One backups suck for SMS and MMS, so I always have to rely on the SMS Backup & Restore app (formerly owned by Carbonite), but it can't handle RCS.",2,0.75,5.0,"Since RCS isn't too standardized in the system yet it's actually stored as SMS/MMS.  Apps like SMS Backup Restore will still catch them but save and restore them as SMS/MMS.

I'm pretty sure if you clear data on Google messages it forgets the messages were RCS.

ALSO: This is assuming we're talking about Google Messages RCS. I haven't found a way to do this yet. It's the only reason I keep rcs disabled. As far as I can tell, the only method is to rely on Google's automatic backup, which I've found to be unreliable.

On the other hand, I chose to switch to Signal: https://signal.org/install for as many people as I could.. Curious what you mean by it not handling RCS. I've used RCS since beta and SMS Backup & Restore without issue. Some characters they have issue with, but that has been the same before even RCS was a thing.

My last backup, 40274 were successful, and only 58 were invalid. I can't imagine out of the 58, anything was so important I'd rather not use RCS.

Now, the backups are 1GB each, so make sure you have the space in Google Drive for storing offline, but better than no protection. I would also guess that some of those failures are screen shares of gameplay my friend and I send each other, I don't need those synced so those failures are fine.

Edit: Just realized I can go and look at the failures. They were all messages that failed to send for unrelated network issues, none of them even had any emojis or anything. So they would have failed with or without RCS.. It broke for me when I went from my pixel 2 to a pixel 4. Says its enabled but everything gets sent SMS and anyone who sends me RCS it just never arrives. Doesn't tell them I haven't had it though. If I disable RCS they then get updates saying delivery failed even if it's days later..

Heat is generated when calculations are performed. If lots of calculations for the chip are performed (compiling, rendering, transcoding, gaming ); any chip will heat.

One thing that you could do is disable/limit apps from using mobile data in the background. Data Saver is one way.

84,Is there a way to add volume slider in the notification/control center panel?,hbqedc,2020-06-19 00:23:28,"Is there a way to add a volume slider in the drop down menu?  I mean of course there are apps in playstore for that but if there is a convenient root solution possible for this that would be great.

The idea is simple. Like you swipe down, you bring down your notification/control center and at the bottom is a brightness slider, instead or just add an option for volume slider. Like in IOS control center. 

Now i can't use the typical iOS control center thing on my phone since I'm using OP6T android 10 oxygen os. Gesture based navigation (with swipe from left/right to go back)

I would always prefer a volume slider instead of a brightness slider or just an option to add two sliders.


The thing is, i hate using buttons, additionally i have a hard case on my phone so the buttons are hard to use.

I wish to operate my phone without any buttons, at all, i can open and close the screen, but there are times like i could adjust volume while listening to music, since Spotify doesn't provide that. 

This maybe a small thing for most people but this is exactly why i would've loved to use an iPhone 8 atleast. When you could easily access all your needs by swiping from bottom.

Its hard to imagine how everyone feels fine with this? No one genuinely cares about this? Especially those who have bad volume buttons or broken buttons. I hate to rely on buttons. This feels very, ancient. Especially when you have long phones, to reach the top with your finger in long phones is quite an inconvenience.

This is of course a very first world problem, but i guess in a world where people are trying to make everything as convenient as possible.. why not this?

(I do not wish to sound as a very rude person, if i do, i sincerely apologise, i guess i just feel a bit baffled about this omission in android when iOS users enjoy quite convenient and polished stuff like this)",21,1.0,9.0,"I forgot what it’s callled I’ll try to find out and edit this but there is an app or root that makes it like the iOS control center.. Does this work on non-Samsung phones?

 [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.sidegesturepad&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.sidegesturepad&hl=en) 

I just know that some Samsung apps work on non-Samsung phones, like the Internet Browser.

Anyway, on Samsungs, when you have this active, the side gestures of the Android 10 gestures are deactivated and get replaced with this (but the swipe up for home and recents and Assitant are retained). One of the options in this app is quick tools, so you could set a gesture to get a floating window populated by stuff you set, one of which is a volume slider. Basically you can set a gesture that throws up a floating window that can have volume controls as one of the functions. Kind of like the iOS control center but the gesture to call it up is customizeable.. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rascarlo.quick.settings.tiles

This creates an icon for volumes which brings up a popup displaying multiple sliders

No root required. This isn't exactly what you are looking for, but check it out. It may be close enough to what you want if there is no perfect solution to your problem. I've been using it for months and can't imagine going back.

[Volume Styles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tombayley.volumepanel&hl=en_US)

There's another app by the same author called [Super Status Bar](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tombayley.statusbar&hl=en_US) that will basically do what you want, although it isn't a baked in OS feature. It will however let you swipe down to the status bar and be presented with an on screen volume slider.

Hopefully one of these can help you, or lead you to a similar solution that solves your problem.. I use this one 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.light.volumecontrolnotificationbar

but I also found Knobby to be quite effective.. Oh that won't work at all, if i assume what you're thinking. Assuming you mean i bring up the control center from bottom. Since i use A10 gestures, the control center can't be used from bottom or sideways.

Perhaps the only solution is that the notification/control center from top have more ""functionalities"", even having a volume slider as a basic function would suffice.. Thank you! This is a perfect solution. It is extremely elegant.

I switched modes to swipe from bottom left/right for this.


I'm just a tad paranoid about privacy. Giving this app full access to my whole screen feels a tad discomforting..

102,Where did my downloads go?!,hbjdyo,2020-06-18 17:44:28,"So basically, I had a problem with my phone (Nokia 3.2). The support told me to backup and erase the phone. I backed it up using Android’s own backup feature, but now that I’ve restored the device from that backup I made... where are the stuff from my downloads folder?! I had important stuff there, did Android not back them up or are they somewhere else?",1,1.0,10.0,"The backup only saves your apps and contacts. It doesn't back up everything on the phone because that would take hours to back up and restore. Have you made any backups before deleting everything?
If you didn't, why not?
How can you say anything is important to you if you haven't backed any of it up?

This seems to be a regular thing on Reddit at the moment - lots of people getting angry and very upset  about loosing files but not person complaining ever backed anything up.

If you've have made any recent backs ups, that's your fault, no one elses.. But my iPhone does that no problem? Why can’t Android do it?. I used Android’s backing up feature. It said it would backup ”all my files”. It's his fault for not backing up his important files but it's not his fault that Googles back up system sucks.. Android can, but it differs per manufacturer since Android is an open source OS where anybody can alter it for their own purposes. For example, if you wanted to be backing up your files in your folders to cloud, Google's solution is to have it actively syncing using their Files Go app and you choose beforehand which files are backed up. I don't know what Nokia uses.

Samsung uses their own SmartSwitch backup which also has the ability to backup documents and other files in your downloads folder and such. I believe Huawei and Sony does as well, but they're different from each other.

Android is more like Windows and Linux (Android is based on Linux after all) where you need to do your own stuff yourself, where Apple's iPhone is typical Apple, they think about it for you.. It's no good get triggered because android doesn't do what iPhones does.
Android doesn't back up stuff fully like iPhone, but then android isn't iOS and a Nokia isn't an iPhone.

Nokia support are crap.
if you have important stuff you should back it up regually to Google drive.

There are hundreds of posts here every week from people crying they've lost important files and photos but not one of them has ever made a back up to Google drive.

im really sorry you lost your files, but if stuff is that important to you, you would have made a back up.
Did you?
If you didn't, it couldn't have been ""important""

If you haven't made any back ups recently, that's on you, not on android or the Nokia.
Always back up important files, it takes 20 seconds.

Edit.

Thank you for the downvotes, I really appreciate it.

It's about time people understand that if they consider stuff important to them, then they should be considering making a regular back up of some kind.

Posting here crying or getting angry  doesn't achieve anything.
I'm sorry if anyone considers my opinion harsh or blunt, but it needs to be said.

And yes, the truth is pretty nasty sometimes.. As already explained to you, androids back up feature only backs up your installed app and settings.
It doesn't back up wallpaper, photos and downloaded files.

My point is (and I'm not being mean, I'm making the point so you remember it and never make this mistake again) is if you consider something ""important"" then you make a back up of it incase this happens.

Forget what Nokia told you or what you did, I'm talking about before you had any issues with your device.
Did you make a regular back up to Google drive of your files?

If you didn't back up those ""important"" files then you really got no need or right to complain.
If you considered those files not important enough to back up, then they were not that important to you.

You've just got to go into your device settings once a week or once a month or how ever frequently you feel is necessary, and hit the back up button.
Select Google drive as the destination folder and it's done, it takes less than a minute.
This also avoids the need for you to make angry and frustrated posts here very upset you lost your files.
I totally sympathise, but as you hadn't made any attempt to back those files up before your issues, there really nothing I can say to make you feel any better, apart from don't let it happen again.. I agree. And it's not his fault either he didn't realise he could make those regular backs ups.

Nokia don't tell you that in their crappy device documentation.

And yes, I've just left Nokia for a Samsung.

Terrible devices.. Personally I believe it's the nature of society nowadays where a lot of things are made to convenience them. If we break down a lot of products being sold today, it's more of ""You don't need to think about it anymore, it's automatic!"" I believe it's also one of the reasons why Apple sells well. They do the thinking for you if you need something or not, and they design it to the lowest denominator with as little user involvement as possible. They aren't taught how things work anymore, just the surface level of this is what you do to activate this.

Heck I just had an interaction at r/NoStupidQuestions on someone at what seems to be senior high or college level who didn't understand why there needs to be WiFi to connect to the internet. Like, they were taught how to code a website in school, but weren't taught what the internet is or how it works. He seemed to think, it's just there to pluck out of air.

Those of us who were raised on more involved processes just do the backups out of habit, or set them up to our own preferences beforehand. Some people are also scare mongered to disconnecting stuff from Google but never bothered setting anything alternative up.",952.0,5,66,1

My dad managed to drown his CAT S61(should be impossible, I know). Everything but USB port was working fine. So the phone died because he couldn't charge it.

Fortunately he is really capable with electronics and he opened the phone and found out that battery connector was covered in rust, so he fixed it, and USB works now.

Unfortunately the phone is stuck in fastboot mode ([pic](https://m.imgur.com/a/FXkYwCC)), and none of the options leads to successful boot. Only CAT logo shows up and then we are back in fastboot screen.

The only thing we need are the photos from internal memory, is there any way to get them? I looked up a few things, and the easiest way seems to be  flashing custom software, but there is none for CAT S61 as far as I know.

Just got my first oneplus device, the 7t pro, loving the device so far! Coming from an LG G6 it's an absolutely amazing device.

Recently my friend told me about problems with apps (mainly banking apps, but also some other apps) -- some of them refuse to perform some operations (or refuse to work at all) on AOSP-based or rooted firmwares. Some of them just check for root, while others also check for custom firmware (like LineageOS). I'd like to note that it's not like VLC on desktop that can be compiled to refuse to run as root -- these apps refuse to run if the user isn't restricted enough on their own device.

Some people say that ""itsforsecurity"" -- but desktop operating systems give you root (or administrator in Windows) during the installation process. Why are desktop versions of these same applications that don't run on rooted mobile devices, don't care about root on desktop?

By a 3rd party application: Logging keyboard inputs, recording screen, read the memory allocated for the banking app, disable Android's built-in security. 

This all can be done if your phone is rooted, and that's why the banking application doesn't allow you to use them. It's a security risk they are not willing to take.

I know this sucks, because there are phones that come rooted out-of the box, like some Meizu models, but that's the case.

Running an application as administrator in Windows isn't anything similar like rooting your phone. It's just the same name for two totally different things. Don't compare these two things..

That's where encryption comes in. Encryption scrambles data in such a way that it can only be unscrambled with the correct password. There's no way to recover the data unless they can log into your Google or iCloud account.. Your phone should be encrypted by default unless you've unlocked the bootloader, rooted it or anything like that.

Screen worked no problem, I'm logging into everything again and start an update. I put it in a case and it must have held down the power button as the phone turned off.

I thought it would just restart, so I took it out the case and let it do its thing. It didn't restart, but turned off, and now won't boot properly.

When I hold down the power button, the One Plus bootloader comes on for a few seconds then disappears. 

When I hold vol up+boot, I go into recovery mode with the options to: START. Restart bootloader. Recovery mode. And Power off.

EDIT: It's been 10 minutes since booting, and still nothing.. Having a look at that article, and the phone has to be in developer mode. 

Not sure that mine is, and I'm unable to put it in developer mode without being able to get into the device.. Hold power + volume up go into fastboot mode, connect to your pc, run the command 'fastboot devices' you should see a weird number and fastboot next to it if it is recognized.

Next step is to download twrp version of your phone on your pc or laptop

Then go back in fastboot mode same as before and run 'fastboot boot recovery.img' as in recovery img being your device twrp version just type fastboot boot and then drag the file into your terminal, that should boot up twrp on your device which gives you access to adb and wipe etc etc be carefull what you do here. ""This looks legit"" O lawd, meaning my phone and files can be saved?

Is there a name for the process you described where I can Google and follow a detailed step by step? I'm not very phone or tech savvy and would need something like that.

You've given me hope. Thank you. 1) on your laptop go here
https://twrp.me/oneplus/oneplus5.html
Download the img file (Europe or Americas)

2) put your phone into fastboot mode like before and plug into your laptop

3) open terminal
Run 'fastboot devices' like before make sure it appears like before

4) run 'fastboot boot path\to\file' path is: just drag the img file from you downloads folder on your terminal 

5) You should be in twrp on your device now

Your phone can be saved yes, files I'm not sure
This process will just boot the twrp on your device, it's not actually on your phone. Awesome. Will try this when i can.

Is there any way i can save the files before trying this?. I'm on the download site now, and met with many different download options.

Is there a specific one I'm after?. Also, what do I do once I'm in the twrp of my phone?

Sorry for all the questions.. It's just really confusing to me, haha.. Not really just download the one that fits you. Just to check if you can access twrp that's why you use the boot command, next step is to actually do stuff, like unlock bootloader and flash twrp, your data will be wiped

Before do this you need make sure you absolutely tried everything to boot up the phone in a normal way, so be sure about that. [This](http://prntscr.com/t2b9qf) is what I mean by the many different choices. Does it matter?. So, I just tried to boot up again, and got a screen saying that my battery was too low, and that it needs to charge. I plugged it in and will let it charge before doing anything.

Does this change anything?. The first one. Ya let it charge for some time and try boot it after",723.0,8,264,1

I am on a budget and not sure if going with an on-demand service like audible will fit me in the long run. I find it quite good but a bit overpriced IMO. So, I thought using a text to speech application (Android-based) would be a good idea.

What mobile application for text to speech conversion would you recommend? Features I am looking for: voice to feel more natural, option to bookmark, simple. It would be nice if the app is FOSS. Thanks.",1,1.0,0.0,notexthere,0.0,8,133,1

 when my phone boots-up, the ptocesses of the phone does not start until you unlock the phone.

For example, the bluelight-filter does  not get initiated, and the Always.On.Display does not start until the phone is unlocked. Also the fingerprint-unlock does not work after boot-up.

 Why does this happen?

Any help is appreciated.",5,0.86,9.0,"To stop malware from being executed I guess.
Also the fingerprint / face unlock being disabled is to stop the police and other people from going through your phone.. That's normal, you must do your password before using face recognition or fingerprint scanner

Also for the blue filter, just wait, it's booting up. There's a couple reasons for this. 

1. A cold boot is doing a lot, so anything optional that can be pushed off it to make it faster is a win. Blue light filter would definitely be something not immediately vital to startup.
2. Security. Anybody can boot a phone. Only the owner should be able to unlock it. Fingerprint readers are hilariously insecure, so the phone forces a pin or password because its higher security. Always On Display could also show personal info, so its best to make sure the right user has unlocked the phone before displaying. 
3. Permissions. Apps have permissions too, so only certain ones can be run during startup. If the developer didn't put in a System App permission or something like that, it likely can't be run until the device unlocks.

There's probably more reasons too, but those are the big ones off the top of my head.

This means I can't restart it and I tried USB debugging but my phone wasn't set to file transfer. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

That should disable 3rd party apps, including Macrodroid. Once you get to the homescreen, uninstall Macrodroid and reboot to exit safe mode.. I have an idea, but do you have usb debugging on?. Boot in safe mode and uninstall the app that cause the problem. The phone turns itself off before I can restart it, which effectively disables the power button hold. If you just keep holding the power button it should restart. Keep holding the button, it will feel like it isn't going to go.. Will your phone turn off completely by holding the power button? If so, turn it off and then back on, but as soon as it starts booting up hold both the volume up and down buttons. That should send you into safe mode, and then you can uninstall as recommended above. 

If it won't power off normally you have to drain the battery, then boot into safe mode once you plug in and it powers on.. It locks itself as if the power button was pressed not held.. It turns itself off like it would by tapping the power button. I think i'll just have to drain the battery thanks. Is there a way to do it quickly without the screen?. I know you solved the problem already, but if something like this happens again, you can search on Google or any engine how to force restart the phone to see if that helps.

I have a Samsung and I have to hold power+home+vol down at the same time for several seconds. Maybe yours need another combination besides just holding the power button as the others users suggested.. I'm glad you got it fixed. But, I would have held the button down after the screen turned off for quite some time. Sometimes it really feels like it isn't going to force a reboot and you have to hold it a bit longer..

172,Custom Rom for LENOVO Z5,hatx0p,2020-06-17 15:56:24,I need good battery backup and performance... I used to use havoc os back when android oreo was out but the charging speed was so low... Which rom should I use for Lenovo z5?,2,1.0,14.0,"Goto the Lenovo z5 threads on XDA and ask there.. There are some ROMs mentioned there, most of them r android pie, I don't have any problem there, but I would like android 10 if I can get it to work properly. If xda doesn't have it, no one will.

I always advise people to go there rather than ask questions here which are more than likely going to be ignored.. well i found some articles in getdroidtios....... i will try them later. DO NOT USE that site.

My brother bricked his Alcatel device earlier this year trying to root it following one of their guides.

According to XDA there is NO root strategy for his Alcatel device, but he followed a guide on getdroidtips and f***** it up.
His device has a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip but get droid tip state MTK tools should be used.
That is insane - you never use MTK tools on a Qualcomm chip device.

Obviously if you choose to ignore xda and go elsewhere you do so at your own risk, but in my experience, ignoring XDA and doing something else usually ends in tears.

Get droid tips device guides and ROM/root/flashing  instructions simply cannot be trusted.

Don't say I didn't warn you.. If you do, I can garuntee you will be back here tomorrow crying your bricked your device.

Get droid tips can't be trusted, their information is old and completely incorrect.

Use XDA or don't bother because it's simply not worth messing up your device.. the posts of xda developers are so abbreviated , i dont understand anything.....theres a post about updated ZUI but, theres only link for the rom, not even mentioned what am i supposed to do with it, how to flash it, nothing. This ROM contains full instructions.

https://forum.xda-developers.com/z5-pro-gt/lenovo-z5-pro-no-gt-qa-guides-development/rom-dotos-3-0by-oceandepth-t3938142/amp/#aoh=15924269416182&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s

There are instructions here how to flash android 10.

https://forum.xda-developers.com/z5-pro-gt/development/install-android-10-beta-lenovo-z5-pro-gt-t4035205. mine is z5, not pro or gt, and those mentioned are really old, i want to use some latest roms, like havoc 3.5 or lineage 17.1. As already explained to you - by more than one person, if XDA hasn't got what you want, then it's not available.

Havoc 3.5 is not available for your device yet and neither is lineage OS 17.1 probably because it's difficult to get android 10 working on your device.

You are unfortunately going to have to wait until those ROMs become available, or accept the fact android 10 ROMs may not ever come.

I also suggest you don't do anything if you don't understand the terminology or instructions.
It's really not worth messing up your device and I really don't want to see anyone have that happen to them.. If the roms you want are not yet available I don't think your device will get them.

XDA is the only place to go for afterlife development and if there is no one in the community interested in getting android 10 ROMs onto your device, they are not going to happen.
I'm not sure android 10 is that easy for your device, if it was, then it would have already happened.

So right now your either got to use older custom ROMs, wait for a developer to work on a new android 10 ROM or forget the whole thing and move on.

Just a word of advice.

If you don't understand anything you read on XDA, forget flashing any ROMs or doing anything to your device.

Too many people go rushing into flashing ROMs or unlocking bootloaders without understanding or even reading the instructions provided and end up posting here crying the following day begging people to help them fix their bricked device.

I'm not being mean, but I don't want you to become another statistic.
If you yourself are now admitting you don't understand what you are reading I strongly urge you not to do anything and forget the whole thing, only because I don't want to see you mess up your device because you don't understand what to do.
If you don't understand anything, there's a huge risk of you messing everything up and leaving your device completely knackered and unusable, which I don't want to see or encourage.

Sorry.. well, i have used custom roms on my device before and i am sort of familiar with the process, the problem with this device i am facing is i havent worked with lenovo phones before, they are talking about its storage being A/B type, stock rom being qpst/qfil (i know what qfil is, just didnt have to work with it before) and i dont know if i can use some gsi roms on this device, i used an asus zenfone max pro m1 before and custom rom process on that device was a breez. so, i didnt have to do much research on how they works or stuff, but now if i need to, i  will. i have unlimited time due to pandemic and i need stock android experience with good performance to get the most out of my phone, i guess thats what custom rom is about.... Of course, I fully respect that.
I'm using devices that are ""A only"" partition and like you, I've got several years experience of flashing custom ROMs on several devices (mostly Samsung and Motorola)

But

With the advent of project treble and GSIs even Ive found the process of flashing ROMs and disabling force encryption daunting, confusing and quite difficult.
The worst offender for is Motorola - now owned by Lenovo.
The last two Motorola device I had were extremely difficult to flash and get a GSI to even boot.
This process was not made any easier by confusing, contradicting and difficult to follow instructions and yes I'm referring to xda.

I mean no offense by suggesting the process may be beyond your abilities.
I personally found the process far to complex and fraught with problems that I simply gave up and left my last Moto running pie when there are several good android 10 GSIs for it.
I would rather ""leave well alone"" than mess up a device just to put android 10 on it, when pie works so well.. I can work with pie, android 10 wasn't that much of improvement from pie. if I can get android 10 gesture running and a recorder with internal audio recording, I don't mind pie and there's a stock rom of android pie mentioned in xda forum about this model.....but there's no process mentioned, just a MEGA link of that rom, like bruh... 

I have used roms with Samsung j1 nxt, Xiaomi note 6a, Asus zenfone max pro m1....none of them gave me this much trouble like my recent 2 phones, realme 3i(that phone doesn't allow bootloader to be unlocked) and this Lenovo z5...

 I think I will try flashing that android pie rom and try fluid navigation gesture with adb and call it a day",1115.0,5,34,1

And is Lineage a good choice if I want to have a fast phone? Battery life doesn't really matter to me, since I loose around 50% per day, so a faster but less powerefficient rom would be an option.

I was using an unofficial build, and it never actually was updated, yet again TouchWiz wasn't being updated either. Official builds will receive updates like an OTA, but unofficial builds may need to be flashed manually or may not even be updated at all.. It depends really, if it's an official build of Lineage OS it's likely to have OTA updates just like Samsung would have (it notifies you about the update available to download, then once it's downloaded it boots into recovery and runs a script to update then reboot to system). If it's an unofficial build you might need to download the update yourself, manually boot into recovery, flash it, clear cache and dalvik then reboot to system. Ok, in this case I will see if I can find an official build.  
Did you see any increase in performance on your j3, once you switched? Or was it only the appearance / new android experience that made it better than TouchWiz?. Appearance was better, battery life was much better and so was performance. TouchWiz is just too bloated and demanding for the low budget hardware of the J3 I think, so simple stock-like android performed much better on it.",278.0,3,109,1

Mine come in about every 10 seconds.. What phone do you have?  Many phones have different ways of handling notifications and power-savings, and the ways of changing/disabling varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.. Two tips:

1) Relax, there's no point getting stressed about mails. Everything and everyone can wait 20 min. Otherwise they would phone you instead of mailing you.

2) Disable any battery saver that you might have and disable ""battery optimizations"" for your mail app. 

Most phones have push notifications so the waiting period should be less than a minute. Be sure you don't close the mail app (just leave it open in the background).. I dont think i have that option on the Pixel 4XL. I have a Pixel 4XL. Hehe, I need to take my emails as soon as they get in to make my job, so it's not a question of relaxing or not, it's part of the job :)

I just turn off battery optimization for Gmail, i'll see if it work. THanks!. It should be baked into the Gmail. Setting notifications, then all or every or something. Good luck.. Install FairEmail from F-droid.org (to preventing it from depending on google play services, so if the delay be because of google play services, it won't affect this time) 

Also i suggest you to install F-droid app so you be sure that you always have latest version of FairEmail. (also do the steps below to F-droid app so it can run automatically and check new versions or make sure you manually tap on update repes button and then check updates tab to be sure you always have latest version of FairEmail)

Then create an app password in your account and login with it with the app. (i suggest to enable 2 step verification before this step if you didn't it)

Then exclude FairEmail from battery optimizations and allow it to have unrestricted data access.

Also if you have a phone with strict battery saving behavior like huawei make sure to set FairEmail to manual and enable all options for it in 
- battey > app launch
section. (auto start, run in background and etc)

Also exclude it from auto battery optimizations in samsung or smart battery saver in android pie.

+ go to its settings and set the app to check Emails more frequently although it will use more battery.

Also i suggest you to enable  hardned ssl if you have a famous Email service that you are sure that it supports new TLS security protocols. (Microsoft and Google are OK) so your account be more secure.

The kernel is the important part of linux. by flashing one for the wrong device, you can do some harm to your device. It's like putting an engine for the wrong car and expecting for it to work because it's similar. There are build scripts that can help you port nethunter to your phone I think.

186,Should I root my Android in 2020?,haqfkt,2020-06-17 12:46:37,"I've written a blog on the topic "" Should I root my Android? "", and I need help in improving the article guys please help,

Any kind of suggestions are welcome.

You don't need root to install a custom ROM (only an unlocked boot loader), and with custom ROMs you may not need root for many of the features you listed.

Once Google decides to enable hardware based SafetyNet, Magisk Hide (and similar) will no longer work.. Need to fix grammar, punctuation, sentence structure. Nearly impossible to read in the current state.. >Most popular reason why people choose to root is to use custom roms which are basically a modified version of Android.

What? It has nothing to do with each other. You don't need to root to use custom rom, and vice versa.

Sure they usually come together, as it's a nice-to-have, but they are not related...

&#x200B;

>Another reason why rooting is discouraged is that Google and other major OEMs don’t support it.

Not exactly. Depends on the case. Google doesn't forbid apps that require root on the Play Store. It's just silent about them.. Honestly no you really don't need root now. Unlock bootloader yes but that's about it.. Honestly not, android has evolved so much and basically you have things without root that before you needed root.

So, evaluate your needs in rooting your device, such as overclocking or whatever.. Thanks will clear those points, thanks. I thought the main reason to unlock is for custom roms and root, no?

What else is there to unlock the bootloader?. I have always rooted my androids up until buying Pixel 4 and played around with custom ROMs. Adblock was also essential. 

Now I get adblock  by using private DNS which is so easy to setup and there are that many features on stock Pixel Android that I don't feel the need.. I use it for quickswitch, absolute necessity. Also battery charge limiter, build prop editor (to watch 4k high but rate YouTube), ad filtering and apk extraction.. Custom roms yes and recovery but root isn't essential unless you need like magisk to pass safety net.. Ohh, good one. This kind of stuff is also worth rooting.. Is there a good use for recovery nowadays? For some reason I need to always re-flash it to use it, which is very annoying. I used to use custom recovery to easily flash things.. Well my recovery has stuck in place even with mismatched partition error when flashed via fsstboot while running aex 10. So twrp works great.. I see. But do you also have to re-flash it each time?. No. The mismatch partition is on the Moto X and I have a Xperia 10 with it flashed successful to the ramdisk. Both work great.. So no need to reflash. Nice.. On my 2 device I don't but could vary for different devices as some may have use pc to boot up twrp. But most don't need that.. ok",462.0,7,34,1

191,how to automate or silently configure device?,haossk,2020-06-17 10:43:19,"Hallo,

I'm a big fan of all possibilities to automate things so that I can prepare some script or configuration file and then use it multiple times to achieve reproducable results.

I'd like to do some configuration after the initial setup, or maybe even automate the initial setup completely by providing necessary stuff in a response file.

It is so great to setup Linux or Windows unattended, and I'd like to do the same for my family's smartphones. Android does this - to an extent - by offering to restore from a previous device setup, but this option leaves out the most (for me) tedious task: setting up multiple email accounts.

What I mean is setting up the account, WiFi, and some more like setting some particular config items for the keyboard, display, notifications, ringtones, some privacy settings, more email accounts.

I tried Google Business G Suite but (to my understanding) explicitly says it does not push sensitive information like passwords - but that's exactly what I'd want to do - fully configure email accounts including pop/imap/ssl/smtp/password settings.

Is this feasible? When searching the web I find a lot of automation tools but for operating, not for setting up.

There are cases when a phone supports an external monitor (Samsung Dex for example), but they need a special docking station, and it is needed by the phone to support this feature. I'm not sure the Moto G2 will support this.

https://www.androidcentral.com/factory-reset-protection-what-you-need-know

Send it to the recycling centre or place an advertisement in the local area that the Device has been found.
You won't be able to do anything with it at all.

TCL (branded Alcatel in Europe) are notoriously cheap mass produced devices that are nothing special or particularly great and certainly not worth getting excited about if found laying on the pavement.

Edit.

Thank you for the downvotes.

Much appreciated.. AFAIK getting to settings is impossible, unless I can somehow minimize the login sequence (maybe some button sequence is the ticket). I'll give this a shot, if I'm successful I'll let you know :P

appreciate the tip homie. Thanks, you confirmed pretty much what I was thinking. Gonna find a recycling place and just take it there.

Thanks!. FRP on Alcatel is pretty darn easy to get past. Search for hacking FRP or similar phrase.

I'm not sure if it's a generic Chinese product or a specific OEM; it comes with [MobiControl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.soti.mobicontrol.androidwork&hl=en), apparently some kind of corporate access application, and that makes me think it was originally intended for staff use at some office or something and might have been purpose-designed (or at least purpose-configured out of the factory).

It would appear to be new old-stock as it still has the factory protector on the screen and no scratches whatsoever.

It comes with a few basic application, but the Play Store is not present. This is a situation I've found myself in before, and what I usually do is go to APKMirror and download the latest Play Store APK as well as the latest Google Play Services. Once both are installed it usually works.

Not this time, though - I just get the ""sign in"" button that doesn't work and a three-dots menu that gets me in a very sparse settings menu if I click ""settings"" and crashes the play store if I click ""updates"".

This isn't going to be some hacky performance machine, just a light-duty tab for watching films and occasional light Internet use, so worse comes to worst I can just sideload everything off of APKmirror - but that way I wouldn't get any updates unless I downloaded everything manually every time, which I can *not* be arsed doing.

Short answer: yes avoiding the extremes of a battery's charge prolongs its' life. Up to you if the tradeoff is worth it.

Here's a comparison: have 2 of the same phone in my family, both the same age. I charge mine 3-4 times a day (or more) between 25 and 85%. The other one is charged 1.5 times a day (once in the morning and maybe a top up in the afternoon, but not usually). Mine runs multiple sync jobs, moves a lot of data, etc. 

After 2 years of hard use on mine, my battery health is nearly identical to the phone that gets charged to 100% once or twice a day.

Anecdotal I know, but I've seen serious battery degradation in other phones. I hammer on it.. A cycle is from 100 to 0 to 100 again. Counts against the cycle lifespan as 1

A short cycle say 80 to 20 to 80 counts as .5 against the lifespan

Is there any way to transfer my number AND my google accounts and apps and photos?  Mainly need my google accounts as I do not know their password and I NEED to be able to use them? How? Help?,21,0.85,28.0," always make a backup of all passwords and important information incase this ever happens again in the future. 

Don't rely on your phone as a primary save device for everything. If you are lucky you should be able to get in through Google just hit forgot password. Go to your carrier. Tell them your phnoe broke and the sim broke too. They will give you your sim back. ( same number same all just different actual chip ). Then put the sim in your new/old phone. Insert sim in your device and if it s an older phone, factory reset it, if it s new then just insert the sim and set it up. When google asks you to set up your google account, put your email and press ""forgot password"", then you will be prompted with multiple options to retrieve your account. Google automatically backs up your apps contacts messages and settings. So retrieving you Google Account would be your best bet.

Tips to help you prevent this in the future:

\- although I do not recommend this write you pasword on a piece of paper and put it somewhere like behing a magnet on a refrigirator, or behind a frame or something, this way you rememebr to associate the given object with your password.

\- When making a new password, write it down on a piece of paper next to your nightstand and for a week, every time you go to sleep, just set yourself a goal to say your password out loud 30 times. If you do this for a week, you will remember your password.

\- Use google photos for unlimited high quality photo backup. As the sentence suggests it backs up ALL your photos to your google account for free.

\-Make a slightly different password for every site. I am not ging to expect you to remember 20 different password, but create a ""master password"" like. If your name is Emily Baker and you were born in 1999 on the 2nd of january. set a semi-complicated password like Em0201Ba99ker1999. For every site like Facebook, at the end of your password ad a suffix like ""fb"", for Snapchat add ""sc"", for twitter add ""tt"", for reddit add ""rd"". or something to remember the app by, this way you only have to remember your master password and then remember which suffix you chose.

\-never store important data locally, unless you have to identical hard drivees which you copy to each other every few months, then do NOT store data locally. Your phone can break, your hard drive WILL break at some point. Always store photos on goolge photos. For every other files there are stuff like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. You can even do something like create a telegram account and make yourself a server which you can make private and post different kind of files.

Lesson to be learnt: Phones are phones, and phones do break so back up everything, it's ussualy free :). How... How do you not know your passwords?

Sorry to say, I think you're hosed.. If all it lost, you can still retrieve your account from Gmail login website. Go to [Google.com](https://Google.com) and try to sign in. If you don't remember your password then just do the forget password thing.. All my accounts have one or the other recovery accounts whose password I remember and those of my other accounts as well. So in case I forgot password of one I can just reset and it's quite handy and easier to remember one passwourd than 10

You recover accounts, photos and files if they were synced to something like google drive.. Sorry to hear. Do not go to toilet with tablet ot cellphone. Lesson learned. I would think you will need the passwords to the accounts to log back into them on another device.

Maybe move the sim to a working device to see if you can recover the account on a computer, if you need to use 2fa or something.. > always make a backup of all passwords 

SECURE backup - use a password manager like BitWarden - its free and Open Source.

You just need to remember your main password for this, and everything else is stored securely in their for you.

The key is to choose a strong password that is also memorable.. I've spoken to people who don't even know they have a Google Account or Apple ID, never mind that there is a password.. Accounts 5+ years old on auto login with saved passwords on phone.. Well idk that info except my phone number?. Exactly - how does someone not think to do this?. This is your best bet. Pop the SIM into a new device (or have your wireless carrier activate a new device with that phone number if you think the SIM is compromised/damaged). That way when you go to sign into your Gmail accounts, hopefully so long as you allowed Google to know your phone number, they'll be able to text you with a code in order to reset your password.. What all does sim transfer?. Call colin. When you log in by Gmail website, fill your Google account and hit ""forgot password"" it will send unique code to your phone number or other recovery email (most of the time you'll successfully recover that account). So are you saying that you don't even know your own Google Account ID?

This is your email address, usually an @gmail.com address.

There is an option to recover your password from there.. They will call you. I've done it to get into an email before.. Your phone number. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

Though in an 8 bit screen the video player rounds or places dots anyway.

The Snapdragon 617 does not seem to have a chip that decodes 10 bit. So, an emulator (for a relatively new technology) would have to be used.

Merchants are whatever establishment that you are purchasing from. It's not the payment method.. I don't know if they support Google pay or not but assuming they do I wonder if I can use the card at multiply spots because Google doesn't actually give the card info to the merchant when you use it. Whatever limitations that that card has is set by the card issuer. So it doesn't matter how you use the card, it will have those limitations regardless. It's not the merchant who decides.

Software Version H63120o

T-Mobile 

(Apologies for the formatting. I am on mobile)

So, not gonna lie, I was browsing a rather sketchy video site in chrome. No, it wasnt PornHub. It was a """"""Free"""""" video site where you could watch and download pretty much any kind of video from any website or streaming platform (YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, Disney+, ~~OnlyFans,~~ HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, Snapchat, etc. etc.)

As I was browsing, this download prompt from Chrome popped up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"". I already know that Flash doesn't have an Android app nor does Android does need an app for viewing flash content. So, I basically said ""FOH"" and clicked cancel. A short while later, another download prompt showed up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk"" as ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" already existed.

Obviously, I clicked cancel again, closed the site, backed out of Chrome entirely and began searching through my files. There was nothing in my downloads folder that was named ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" at all. There were, however, three randomly named ""part"" files in there which were created literally a minute before I started looking through my files (according to the details at least).

So I deleted the three part files and, to be on the safe side, I decided to revist the site to see if I could retrigger the download prompt. I know, that was probably stupid, but again, there was no ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" in my files, only the three last files. I figured that if it came again asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" then I'd know I got rid of it by deleting the part files.

But, when I went to the site again, the download prompt came up asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk."" instead. I NOOOOPED out of that again, closed the site, closed Chrome, and forced stopped Chrome.

So here is where my problem comes in.

I checked my downloads folder again and it's completely empty. I enabled ""Show Hidden Files"" and nothing comes up. I went and searched through the Chrome app data on both my phone and my SD Card and still nothing.

I opened up Chrome again and checked the download history and strangely enough, there was a ongoing download for ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" that I most certainly did NOT agree to. Chrome said that it was ""downloading"" the file and had downloaded 11.8MB out of 11.8MB. It seemed to be stuck trying to finish downloading the file, however. I watched it for like 30 seconds and it never seemed to finish. It also had the broken thumbnail icon next to it that (at least from what I've seen) comes up when Chrome tries and fails to download something or the file it downloaded is no longer in the folder Chrome downloaded it into.

Clearing teacher apps *used* to be one the better tips for battery and stuff. Now you don't have to think about it.. Really? I thought this is for new phones with high specs as they are now smarter and will manage your battery and ram themselves and closing them yourself will just make it harder for the phone like it stresses the CPU, double the ram usage, consume more battery and make your phone slower?. Absolutely nothing to do with specs. It's all about software. Android is built the same for ALL phone regardless of specs. Sometimes manufacturers like Samsung will add on their own stuff but under the hood it's the same whether you're running a Pixel 3XL or some cheap Samsung you got. As long as they run the right version of android, it'll be OK.

I can't see which version of Android it was introduced on but I can see it existed in 2016 at least. I didn't google that hard but I quickly found an article explaining android self managing this. Which was Android Nougat or Android 7.0 (we're on 11 currently). However it could have been years before that. 

The thing is. Android manages stuff in the background. It'll freeze apps so they won't run stuff. But if you go back to it, it starts where you left off. Starting up apps takes more effort than just continuing. It's like picking up a book with a bookmark, you just open the page where you were at instead of trying to figure out and getting to where you were before which takes time and effort. Apps have to go through their startup process, log in, do whatever they do and then you can go but they YOU might need to get back to the point where you were or whatever. All takes you time which is more for the CPU and RAM to do and especially the battery.

There's also going to be some apps that need to perpetually run in the background and killing them just forces them to restart. Like facebook, you might have it set to see where you are, send notification etc. Even closing the app won't stop those and something needs to run. So closing it doesn't do much if anything but make it resart and go to more effort to find where it was.

And again. Whether you have a big flagship or a cheap budget phone. As long as they're on the same operating system or relevent ones. It's pretty pointless. Unless you're running Android v2.4 or something ancient. I still kill my apps from time to time if they're misbehaving.

This effect is also more noticeable when Night Light is turned on.

Android: version 10

After a recent update, my schedule text message feature quit working correctly. I have many health issues and heavily rely on this feature to communicate with my family. If someone could help it would be so appreciated.

The problem: The texts now send at random times as opposed to their scheduled times. For example, if I would schedule three texts at 7:00, 7:01, and 7:02, respectively, they would each send at that exact time. Now they might send at 7:06, 7:15, and 7:24. Basically the pattern has been: first text sends at completely random time, then each subsequent text schedules nine minutes after the last one. 

I also used to schedule three texts at one time, say 10:00am, but instead of all sending at 10:00 like they used to, they all break up and send at random times as well. Depending on what I'm trying to communicate, it's important they get sent at specified time.

I've used this feature for years on all my previous phones and this one, never a problem until last update.I can't find anyone to help because most people didn't even know this schedule text feature existed, even though its been available for quite some time.

I was able to make this change on Android 9, but since the phone has been updated, the network selection just does not work for me.

Looks like I am not the only one experiencing this issue. Another user, who owns a different phone and the same carrier  has also reported to me that he had very similar issues after updating to Android 10

My question is, whether anyone has experienced same issue after updating to the latest version of Android and if anyone knows what could fix the issue apart from downgrading the software.

I will appreciate all of your answers.

So yesterday I went to the grocery store, unplugged my phone as I normally would and came back to my truck. I plugged my phone back into the charger and immediately got the notification for ""moisture detected in the usb port"" (this was due to I suppose leftover condensation from a drink in my cupholder)

I followed the prompted steps, gave it a shake and let it air dry for about 1.5 hours. The icon was still in my notification bar, so I let it sit with a blow dryer about 2 feet away on the low/cool setting for roughly 30 minutes. My Usb port had to be dry and I even checked it pretty thoroughly considering. I saw several videos and threads online saying to restart your phone with the charging cable plugged in and the icon/notification would go away and I charge my s8+ via charging cable.

So the thing is that I have a Bluetooth headphone but its microphone is so horrible people can't understand me if I use it. So I'd like to use it only for output, and internal microphone as input on Discord.  
I know there are a lot of threads about this but either they don't work for me or there isn't any solution on it.

# Solution #1

  
I thought about installing pulseaudio but  
\- it doesn't seem stable  
\- I don't know if it could allow me to do this (could it?)

# Solution #2

  
I also thought about another solution which could be disabling external microphones making them unusable at all, but I don't know if it's possible, and if it is, how?

# Solution #3

  
I also thought about preventing Android to detect the microphone on the headphones, making them recognized without microphone.

# Solution #4

  
Or I could make an application which allow me to do it, but how? Is it possible? It doesn't seem to be.

First, if you flash a different distribution of Android, some of them allow you to skip installing the Google apps. Also, Samsung have their own versions of many Google Android apps, so even out of the box you can avoid some of it.

Email (the phone's ""accounts"" settings page should support all of these):

* Hotmail
* Yahoo
* Outlook
* Host-your-own (probably cost a small fee for hosting; you will need to know some technical detail to set it up with your phone)

App Stores:

* F-Droid (all free/open source)
* Amazon. come over to r/privacy and r/privacytoolsIO, there are lots of suggestions. I don't think it's easy to escape the ""Google Ecosystem"".
It will take a lot of effort and sacrifice to switch to another services, because others are too trying to get their users fall into their ""Ecosystem"".
Nonetheless if you're trying to escape the Google services then try others and then decide which one suits you best for your need.
Best of luck.. Here's what I use

email - Proton Mail

storage (equivalent to google drive, photos etc) - Hetnzer next cloud for $3 a month

search - duckduckgo

youtube - I use NewPipe and dont sign in

music - sd card

maps - i still use google maps

apps - use fdroid for opensource apps where possible, apkmirror for most other things.

browser- NEVER use chrome - use firefox. Yes. I've been working on moving away from it for a while now.

r/privacy and r/fossdroid have extensive posts about switching away from Google to alternatives.

I would urge you not to think of it as an all or nothing thing. Any changes you can make will still limit the amount of data Google is collecting on you and further decreasing your dependence on it.

You can also ask me if you're wondering about alternatives for a specific product.. Google entirely (primarily play services): not without custom firmware

A lot of google's more general bullshit (gmail, their super intrusive message monitoring app, contacts ~~sniffing~~backup, that super invasive 'digital wellbeing' surveillance software, etc.): Yes. go into your apps list, show system apps, and disable all the crap.

Google will still want you to add a google account to your phone in the wizard, but it is possible to skip. It is possible to create a google account with a non-google email address; you don't actually need a gmail account for that.

Email: https://www.privacytools.io/providers/email/. I've been asking myself the same question, i still don't have a full answer but, if you really want to use Android without some form of Google spying on you, i suggest the following. If you can, maybe you can try this:

1) download a **custom ROM** or AOSP (without the Gapps or Google services) for the note 9 

   ***(i have yet to try it myself on my note 9)*** 

2) download **F-droid**, install it (it's a FOSS based app store)

3) download **Aurora store** from F-droid, install it (it goes into google play store , using a spoof account or anonymously) 

Downside of Aurora store is that apps you've download from it, won't allow you the ability to make in-app purchases. 

downside of not having google play services (if i'm not mistaken -- correct me if i'm wrong yeah) is that you can't use GPS , you can't use push mail from gmail. 

alternatively, you can get one of those Linux-based phones, but to me, it's still in its infancy stage and well, it has a long way to go. Good concept, but i see not much support for it...unfortunately.. https://e.foundation/

Ever heard of these people?. The only way to escape Google is with an ASOP custom ROM. I would go with Microsoft apps if you want things to integrate.

Forget about a flagship phone, just find a cheaper alternative that has unlocked boot loader (Xiaomi?) Look at the LineageOS list of phones, for example.. Get the most recent Huawei phones.. Check this video out! It's got links to alternatives for most of the Google apps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxeeKKfjb5o. If your goal is to entirely get away from google you should be aware that many apps send telemetry (and possibly tracking) data to google when they're being run.. What is your treat model?
Everyone are trying to escape from google.

So where you want to go?
another big tech company like Apple, Microsoft? 

Or some untrustworthy names that can be even more dangerous if they know your sensitive data than google because at least google won't try to help thieves or such with your data!

What you should do is not escaping from google.

Just disable google assistant, deny sensitive google play service permissions like mic and camera and body sensors (if you don't use a fitness tracking app that relies on it.)

Disable all usage stat permissions that you can live without in apps > special access.

If you can, disable google apps and use alternatives.

For ex.  you can check your emails with FairEmail or K-9 or AquaMail instead of official GMail and Microsoft apps.

You can use protonmail, protoncalendar and in the future protondrive instead of their equivalent google services.

You can use bitwarden, standard notes, joplin, evernote and such instead of keep and google password manager.

You can use firefox that they are trying to by far pushing it in the performance aspect and also have great privacy and purpose.

And also disable tracking features that you don't want in your google account settings. (for ex. I need youtube but not others)

And now you are by far more free.

You should decentralize your data, not escape from one service to another. Although you should find a good trade-off between decentralization and productivity because in the end of day the main thing you should care is getting thing done!. In terms of email, I use Outlook. 

Just as, if not more, professional than Gmail addresses.

I made that Outlook account into my Google account though, but idk how far you want to really go.. I think the best way to go about eliminating Google from your life is either 

1) Switch over to apple and duckduckgo services
2) Go with Linux + Firefox on the desktop + graphene/lineageos on the phone. I've heard protonmail is good and I am tired of google too. Google feels like the E corp in Mr. Robot. But at times it does feel convinient but at other times a pain in the ass. The main reason why I don't switch is because of youtube.. If you really want to get away from google.  There are a couple of different ubuntu phones on the market.

They are not as easy to use, but I see from your comments that you are already using ubuntu on your desktop.  When I switched to linux on my phone, I had issues. it took me a while to get it working even close to right. I would advise that if you were trying this, get a cheepo pay by the month crap phone to have something that works while you learn how to make it work....

Good luck! I will be following this post to see how you are doing and see if there are any other thoughts I can chime in on or if there are any new thoughts in the comments I am not aware of!. What is Google doing that makes you feel like they are getting worse and worse?. I'll look into it, thank you!. If you do require google apps like the play store you can i stall OpenGapps, which has a 'nano' varient with only the bare essentials. Then at least you can limit your interaction with Google.. I was skeptical this was a real thing, but it is! Thank you fellow redditor. Oh.... I completely forgot about apps and the obvious ""Google"" play store. Some apps I use are probably not on some other services. I really appreciate the detailed advice though. I'm going to definitely do some research!. I use fdroid on my phone with microg and aurora store. Works great.. Hmm....haven't heard of that. I will check it out!. Thanks! I've switched from using Windows to Linux. I'm still very inexperienced and there are still growing pains. I think this will be similar. If you don't want to use GMaps, I suggest trying out HERE WeGo, it's quite good.. Message monitoring? As in, texts?. Well I hadn't but I was reading up on them. I want to know more, but I'm always up for a fresh new experience. Thank you. Thank you.... this is all good advice!. Note that a lot of people who go this path struggle, as without Google apps you also end up without a number of ""essential"" social apps.. Since you can't use the Play Store, you are reliant on some third party apps like FDroid to get your other apps, and their selection is extremely limited. np!  \^-^. You can get most play store apps from apkmirror.com. what distro do you use?. Me too! Dude one day my laptop froze and after I restarted I was in BIOS and windows reinstalled failed. Linux was my savior and I am still using it. Even though my laptop still feels slow and freezes from time to time :( dunno why. Yeah its not a bad alternative. There's also OsmAnd (as a maps alt). Yeah. A lot of newer phones use a google-provided messaging app to handle text messages.. Your welcome :). Yeah.... I know I'm in for a battle haha. But, it's at least worth looking into and learning a bit. Aurora store for those must have Play store apps.. Can always sideload from APKMirror if it's not available from FDroid. I was already looking on sites of some lesser known apps and finding out I could just get the apks for them directly. This is good to know, thanks!. Just Ubuntu simply because I'm a noob. Chiming in to support Mint! very quick, very comfy for a recent linux user, Not too hard to set up or configure. I have had a few issues, none of them huge. Most of them TBH, are from me not paying attention to directions. I will think, I want to...... whatever..... I will read the directions and then miss one step early in the process.. How old is it? Usually the main two issues are either a failing hard drive (easy to replace) or dust build up in the fans and vents. For that you'll have to take it apart which can be tricky and use a can of compressed air to blow it out.. Cool, thanks!. Auroro store. It's play store but better. Can only download free play store apps.. what's your spec like? i use PopOS. it's a fork of ubuntu but i like it, works well for my laptop and currently windows updates is like a battlefield of broken updates and BSOD. Ubuntu is cool. Linux mint is good too it looks very similar to windows and it's easy to setup. I have mint on another PC at home too. I've encourage new users to Linux with it especially if they're from a windows environment.  I used Pop OS because I want to support system76 because they're doing pretty good stuff. I also think elementary OS has some good ideas too.. Tbh I'm surprised it's still running like this because it's 4-5 years old! And I'm sure there is a dust mine in there lol",1927.0,7,143,1

Weird, but whatever, I just make a new group and add them all in.

So as far as I can see from the comments it is actually possible to install an app to the phone remotely with the Google account?

They (the free ones) are usually known to use your phone (or PC or any device they're installed on) to route internet traffic from other people through your phone and your WiFi, consuming you bandwidth. Idk if they also do other not-so-great things, but usually free VPNs should at least be used with caution and the least times possible because of that.

Edit: I'm not trying to make you paranoid or make you think that you'll be hacked by using a free VPN for some things. Just I would recommend them for personal/private things :). What you described is consistent with Android crashing, which can happen every once in awhile and isn't anything to be super concerned about. This could be caused by a software bug in the coding of Twitter, your VPN, or in Android itself (especially if you updated your phone recently and a big went unnoticed).

The fast battery drain is a little concerning and what leads me to believe there could be an issue with your battery. But all batteries degrade over time and some fail rapidly and can display behavior like this. However it is not out of the question that quick battery drain can be caused by a software issue too.

I would just continue to use your phone like normal. If you notice your battery doesn't last as long or continues to do this, you may want to try factory resetting. Same if it keeps crashing. If the problem persists, consider taking your phone to an expert and they can replace the battery if you need or pinpoint the issue in software and hopefully fix it. 

I would not be very concerned about your phone being hacked. The only way this really happens is if you downloaded some file from a shady website and then executed it. Being hacked simply from watching a video on Twitter is very very unlikely. 

If it gives you some peace of mind, you can factory reset your device after backing up your data somewhere else. It certainly won't do any harm.. Ok you need to back up your data then go to xda and find a custom rom with Android 10 that's your best bet for security and I recommend to use lineage os if you are going to use a custom rom if not just back up your data then factory reset the phone but I think it wont help as the hacker can integrate the hack in the system so it won't get off the phone so I recommend to use custom rom. I wont, is there a safe affordable one I should get?. is zenvpn safe??? I've been using it once in a while for months now & this article made me paranoid ngl im about to delete the app. cheers, I'll likely switch then. Or is it too late, and it's the case that if you use it a couple of times there's permanent damage? And which VPN should I get instead?. I've run my fair share of slightly suspect files, to be fair. I'm getting more convinced this was some sort of software problem, and the battery seems to be fixed, and is charging relatively normally. I'll probably stop using free VPN's, though.. well, its charging again, and my home screen is back... do you think I have been hacked then??. Some paid ones have free tiers. Windscribe free for example. It gives 10GB per month.. I use Windscribe. You get 10GB free. I currently have two accounts with 20GB each, since they had a free upgrade to 20GB sometime a while back, so I upgraded both of my accs. Speed is ok, and they are quite reliable. Also, their app has a ""stealth"" mode you can enable, which works pretty well in ultra-restricted networks like schools to bypass filters.. Not the guy or gal above but I would recommend proton VPN if you don't care that much about speed.  It's definitely reputable and secure. It's also free for the base level but you can pay to unlock different countries and faster servers. You do need to create an account though.. I don't think there should be any damage if your phone is acting normally again, so it's not too late. 

As for a specific VPN recommendation, I'm sorry but I don't know enough about the different brands of VPNs to recommend you one in specific, as I never had the need to use one yet. Thinking now I only remember NordVPN but that's because I see it a lot on YouTube ads and paid sponsorships. But you can Google what are the best VPNs and there should be plenty of posts comparing the most common ones!. Yeah same. The worst thing I've gotten so far was from an apk website. It just popped ads up on my screen occasionally. But I was able to find the APK and uninstall it.. Doubtful. The only real possibility is if you are rooted or installed some app from an unknown source. If it's a reputable VPN service would cast further doubt. Odd things can happen on Android. 

If you are really paranoid still, do a factory reset or reflash your ROM with ODIN if you want it clean without a doubt. 

Personally I think something just got stuck and coincidentally multiple things occurred as a result.. Who knows maybe it got hacked or maybe not hopefully it didn't get hacked. Are you on the sub? r/Windscribe? They give away like 50GB upgrade codes every now and then.. Dope, I'll check it out.. What is an APK? 

I'm now regretting all those 60p quality arab streams to watch my football club play.... Yeah you might be right as rooting can reduce the security but I mean by rooting is to install a custom recovery and install a custom rom like lineage os and he won't have the root no more unless he wants to flash it as the s9 isn't getting the latest update so Android 10 might help and refresh his s9 with new features and make it lighter. Good to hear. I did a McAfee and Lockwatch scan on my apps, nothing. Not a massively reputable VPN, I think, I want free ones because i dont want to pay for one I barely use. Still it has 10M + downloads, so it can't be that shady. I'm hoping you're right, and it just got stuck. Cheers..

It's an app file. Almost like a .exe for windows. It's just so you can download apps that aren't allowed on the play store or older versions of apps. If you ran one you'd know because your phone would prompt you to enable installing apps from sources other than the play store. 

I wouldn't worry about those streams too much... As long as they're videos and not apk's. Comment edited. 
Disregard. Looks like the S9 family does have TWRP available. 

A custom ROM is an option but you lose Samsung Pay and(?) Google Pay.

It's certainly an option but not required and I see where you're going. Custom ROMs are a rabbit hole I no longer go down. I hate dirty flashing, even with ROMs like former CyanogenMod/Lineage. 

I think it may be worth evaluating if this was more than a hiccup. But personally (and I am an Android enthusiast) would advise against custom ROMs, even reputable/established ones.. As the saying goes, ""if it's free, you're the product"".

Whether it be your data or something more sinister, 'free' comes at a cost and isn't always the best option. The amount of downloads is not anywhere near as important as the reviews and app policies. Everyone wants something free.

 I recommend private tunnel VPN. Good speeds. Inexpensive at $6 monthly. Not #1 for privacy but my preferred choice for Android. If you want something good for free most of the top VPNs offer a 7 day trial. Some require you make an account, some don't.. Mind sharing the VPN name you used here or DM? Out of curiosity I'd like to look at it. Well most of the issues with Google pay is an easy fix I daily drive my phone with custom rom I never liked the way stock ROMs behaved most of them are useless or weird looking. 'Secure VPN'. It doesn't seem the most reputable but does not come across as malicious either. The website location does match that of the developers contact information. Also none of the negative reviews I've read indicate any sort of abuse. It also has the fact of being on the Play Store since 2018. That doesn't mean much as malicious things do go unnoticed on the play store but gives it at least some credibility. 

I'm no security expert but Overall I think you should be fine. If you did an Antivirus scan and that didn't find anything either it's very unlikely and your OS just experienced a hiccup. 

Just keep an eye out for other odd behavior or random reboots. 

You can use Tasker to create a task to let you know if your device reboots or there is a very (by today's standards) primitive app by developer Defim that I used for years called Whole Ready that still works.

Another option is to install a firewall and watch the traffic logs. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard. I have actually used this about a year ago, before I switched to Windscribe, and it was fine. I don't think that it is the problem.",1706.0,7,87,1

355,What happens if you somehow force uninstall all launchers?,h93rlc,2020-06-14 22:59:04,notexthere,10,0.92,15.0,"Do it and let us know. One launcher is normally in /system so unless you use root to uninstall it, you should have a fallback.

I believe I've had the situation before where my only launcher was crashing all the time. I used the notification shade to get to the settings, to get the list of apps, to open the Play Store and install another launcher.. Is this curiosity or in prep of you trying something?. My guess is it would either not let you use the home button or close the app, or crash SystemUI.. I had an old phone that I tried this with. After unlocking the phone, it's just black screen. If you pull down the notification shade and open the Settings, it will open it and just stay there whenever you try to go home. The phone was on Android Lolipop though so it could be different on newer versions.. Your phone works but you can't access most of the stuff.

You need to go back to a place where you had wifi and install a launcher there from a desktop/another phone if you delete your system launcher (requires root).

This was an issue with earlier phones were storage was lacking. It shouldn't be an issue now. I've tried to disable all launchers (including the built in one) using [my app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lb.app_manager&hl=en) (with root of course), and nothing special occurs. Home button doesn't go to launcher. It goes to nothing (wallpaper and navigation buttons and status bar) , sometimes the text ""phone is starting"" might appear too, but you can ignore it.

Tested on Android 10.. If you have no default launcher set, when you tap the home button it prompts you with the list of installed launchers.  
So maybe it'll prompt you with the same list, but empty. And you will only be able to switch between that list and previously opened apps. So make sure to have the playstore in hand.. \+1. You don't have to uninstall it. You can just disable it (using root).. Close what app?

356,Kinda Nervous--Two versions of Google Photos on my Phone?,h93m14,2020-06-14 22:50:15,"*EDIT: Problem solved. It was a shortcut to the web version.*

I don't normally launch apps from my app drawer, as all of the major ones I use are shortcuts in folders in my homescreen tray.  With that said, I was browsing through my app drawer to see if I could free up some space by uninstalling apps, and I happened to notice two different Google Photos apps--one called **Google Photos**, and one called **Photos**.

I have the **Photos** app as a shortcut on my homescreen, so that one looked normal to me when I opened it.  I then opened **Google Photos** and things looked...a bit off.

There was a launch screen with the Google Photos icon on a white background (my phone is set to dark mode), and it said ""Google Photos"" at the bottom of the launch screen in Roboto Condensed, black font.  I know Google uses that font for things, but it just didn't seem ""Google official"" because I also know they don't use black text on their launch screens, and any font would be Product Sans.

Opening the app looked pretty official.  All of my photos and videos, even ones I had taken just minutes before, showed up, and the menu on the side had all of my regular account settings.  Aside from the fact that it wasn't in dark mode, everything there looked legit.

I went back to my app drawer, long tapped the **Google Photos **icon, and looked at the version.  Version 82.  The official **Photos** app I have is 4.51.0.315203446.

When in the info screen, I saw that the **Google Photos** app did say it was installed from the Google Play Store.  When I tapped that, it took me to the store, but it could not find the app.  I immediately uninstalled it, ran SD Maid, and then came here to post.

There were too many strikes against the **Google Photos** app to make me comfortable.  It had a slightly different looking splash screen.  It didn't follow the dark mode theme of my phone.  It was version 82.

I very rarely download anything on my phone maybe other than menus from restaurants, and I don't browse any sketchy websites.  The only unofficial app I have ever downloaded is the modded [QuickPic app from the XDA forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/mod-gallery-quickpic-based-4-7-4-t3790425).

I couldn't find anything about this in a Google search.  Am I freaking out over nothing?  Is there anything I should be doing to my phone to check and make sure there's nothing sketchy on it?",5,1.0,7.0,"Did you check the package name?. The Google pbofosy app in the playstore lists the full app title as Google Photos but when installed it's listed as Photos.

For me the photos app launches with the splash screen like yours. 

Screenshots would have helped. I'm unable to find anything with that version number too. I didn't. I don't know what that means, nor how to do it.. If you still had the app, you could use an app called ""App Info"" to check the package name.

Every android app has a unique package name, you can't install two of them with the same name.. Believe it or not, I found it again when I switched my default home launcher back to Pixel from Nova. It's back in Nova's app drawer, too (see edit below). I installed App Info and looked at **Google Photos** with it. 

Yesterday I said it was version 82, and today it's version 97. I think this might just be a wrapper of some kind though. I opened Google Photos in Chrome for an unrelated reason, and it looks exactly the same as it does in this odd **Google Photos** app.

Anyway, App Info [had this to say](https://i.imgur.com/ilbE2rf.png)...

*EDIT: Could this be a desktop shortcut I made? That was the unrelated reason I referred to above.*. I Googled it and it turns out if you add photos.google.com to the home screen you will get this ""app"" which isn't really an app, just the website that acts like an app.

I added it to the home screen and mine also says version 97.

Imo I think these apps are stupid and it should say it's a web app in the app info, not installed from the play store.. >Imo I think these apps are stupid and it should say it's a web app in the app info, not installed from the play store.

So if I have Spotify playing music it will work normally, so I just turn the volume all the way down and that stops it from rebooting when the screen turns off. This is ofc not ideal.

I tried turning on in safe mode, it still rebooted.

I tried wiping the cache, it still rebooted.

Is there a way? I tried added a blank contact named ""Restricted"", but that did not work. Google support chat said they -think- it filters by number, not contact name.  Anyway to make this happen?  


(I'm a journalist, and all calls from local law enforcement/fire/EMS dispatch centers are automatically blocked at the carrier level. They can't unblock. I get those middle of the night calls about big emergencies or missing kids to post stories ASAP.)",1,0.67,4.0,"It's number-based.

His actual number is in my account. I don't believe it still rings through while I'm on Do Not Disturb. So even knowing the hidden number won't resolve it. 

I think your best bet is to just allow all calls while in Do Not Disturb, or you might need a third party app. I'm not aware of any trustworthy third party apps for this though.. ""Do Not Disturb"" means nothing will make a sound when ringing, except for white-listed contacts.

Blocked contacts are supposed to be blocked, meaning that as soon as it reaches the device, it won't do anything on your side. It should be hanged up.

If you want, you can set a silent ringtone for the people you wish.. Is it the real number and you just don't see it, or do carriers use some number like 000-000-0000 to indicate restricted to the phone? (I tried that one BTW. No go.)",183.0,11,95,1

369,-repeat- could my android have malware or been rooted without me knowing?,h8yhvm,2020-06-14 18:03:07,"I was looking through a younger siblings tablet the other day and I found a folder called ‘data’ then another folder called ‘data’. once you clicked it the top where the names are of the things you have been clicking is the name of a game in the format of ‘com.—whatever game—‘. the folders in the second ‘data’ folder were two folders named ‘head’ and I believe ‘service chat logs’. in the folder ‘head’ there were selfies of maybe five different people and two pictures that weren’t faces. The beginning of each of the pictures begins with either cache or cached and random numbers. two and a half years ago I used their tablet to go onto a chat app I frequently went on, since my phone was broke at the time. I can’t say for certain, but one of the photos looked kind of familiar, but as I said I can’t be for certain. the others I don’t really recognize.

When I tried to click the two files in the ‘chat service logs’ which were named that as well, I didn’t see their full names but they at least began with that. They couldn’t be opened due to I believe not having the app installed. I deleted that app on their 2+ years ago. I just wanted to bring this up because if it was from my app, why would it be under a folder that doesn’t have the apps name? also no other things were available in the data folder. I read online and saw that if you can access the two data folders that your device is rooted? I doubt a five year old could root a device, unless by accident? my other sibling took the sims card out a few months ago, could this be the reason? I just wanted to make sure there was no malware or anything that could have had access to the camera or microphone. that’s really the only suspicious stuff I saw. I believe we have always had that little box not clicked that says if we want to allow other apps that aren’t from google play. so I don’t think it was an outside app, but my sibling would sometimes play low quality games that I think were tailored to kids due to the amount of ads they would throw in. if anyone could give any insight that would be great, thanks! sorry for the repeated posts, but stuff like this scares me especially if there was the ability to access the microphone or camera without our knowledge.",0,0.33,4.0,"This post has made me quite annoyed.

I completely understand and respect people have privacy concerns, but what your post is explaining is completely unfounded and what you said you have read is not true.

1. No one can remotely root your tablet, it's not possible, so calm down, it's not been rooted.
Root needs the bootloader to be unlocked, so you are honestly expecting us all to believe your fear your tablet had been bootloader unlocked *as well* as rooted?
Pull the other one, it's not happened, I can garuntee it.

2. I've not rooted any android device since 2017, and every device I've had since 2017 has had *two* data folders.
Every android device has two data folders.
One in data and one in android / data.
Perfectly normal.
What you read about two data folders only being seen on rooted devices is completely false, total trash and caused you to get triggered over nothing.

I'm especially annoyed because this is now the fifth post you have made regarding this issue, you've posted in places you shouldn't have posted and you've had your post removed three times, and your original post is still live, just no one has bothered to comment, but here you are again, complaining about your fears, which are completely unfounded and totally rediculous.

If you are so concerned about this issue, just factory reset the bloody tablet and start a fresh and be done with it.
It's not difficult.

I also suggest you don't believe everything you read on line and you stop getting so worked up and upset to the point you feel the need to make five identical posts about Samsung's and androids perfectly normal file system, especially with what's going on in the world right now.
Life is far too short to worry about data folders or ghost rooting.
Get over it.

I've reported this post for two reasons.

1. being repetitive - you've already made four other identical posts.

2. This post is Completely unnecessary because the original is still ""live"" just no one has replied to it, probably because everyone thinks it's silly.

I'm sorry to be so blunt but sometimes it's the best way to deal with this. 
Hopefully you will stop worrying, stop making unnecessary repetitive posts and find something better to do to occupy your time than worry about two data folders and ghostly rooted devices.
Reset the device and forget it, please.. My Pixel 3 is not rooted and I can browse the ""data"" folder.. All my device have never been rooted and I can read the data folder. 
And there's two of them.

If you dont know or understand how android works then say so and we will explain it to you.
Stop using your privacy concerns to make it look like you do understand and make it look sinister, because it's not.

You really don't need to make multiple posts either, because that just makes you look obsessive.. Hey, thank you for your comment and explaining it!! I struggle a bit with an anxiety disorder so I definitely understand that I can seem a bit obsessive or annoying, I apologize.

Just regularly clean your phone, look through your installed apps and don't instal stupid shit. Unless you deliberatlely install something sketchy you will defnitely not get any viruses..

Or are you using a launcher you downloaded from the playstore ?

Clear the data and cache of the playstore in device settings / apps / playstore and do the same with the launcher you are using (unknown launcher)

Thank you I just figured it out I had no launcher running in the background my phones launcher is Bixby home now everything is ok. Oh dear.

Bixby home isn't your launcher Bixby is a device assistant, not a launcher.

I think your issues are caused by the system (default) launcher.
It's called One Ui home if you have Android 9.
If you have an older Android version it's called touchwiz home.
This is why I asked what your Android version is, it's very important information to not disclose.

I'm not sure what you have done but you haven't fixed anything by messing around with Bixby.

Bixby is nothing to do with your apps appearing on the home screen only or where they all go.

I have a Samsung on Android 10 here, and what you described has happened before with app installations.
It's was fixed by clearing data and cache of one ui home (for Samsung's running Android 9 and 10 only). OH you're right thanks I had UI HOME has my launcher I dont know what happend to Bixby i thought i fixed it BUT No  i cleared data and cache on UI home now everything works normally THANKS",342.0,3,42,1

I thought magisk has a hide option?. 1. Enable Magisk Hide: Magisk Manager > three lines > settings > enable Magisk Hide. After enabling Magisk Hide go back to the three dot menu and go to the ""Magisk Hide"" section. In there enable all apps which don't use root access.
2. If you installed Magisk through a custom recovery ( don't recommend them ) then go to your filemanager, go the root of your sdcard ( internal storage ) and rename the folder called ""TWRP"" to something else. ( some apps check for the TWRP folder if they can't find root )
3. Change Magsik Manager package name. Go to Magisk Manager > three lines > settings > ""Hide Magisk Manager"" then follow the steps.
4. If your banking app still thinks you have root priviliges then do this. ( This will wipe data so back up ). Search on youtube: how to flash stock firmware for oneplus devices. Then boot into your phone without root, set up your phone, log into every app you have, even banking apps and then root your phone using the official Magisk insatallation guide found on John Wu's Github. After rooting, enable Magisk Hide and everythign and your banking app should not recognise root anymore. I highly advise against using a custom recovery since they always create folders which apps can easily see if you have a custom recovery installed or not. Only flash with twrp if you flash roms or flash new updates constantly.. Yep, I have Magisk. Can you please explain me how to do this ?

Make sure magiskhide is enabled, AND that your banking app is checked in the magisk hide configuration menu in magisk manager. Beyond that if it still doesn't work there's not much anyone can do..

And the icons being ugly has an easy solution, download a new launcher and an icon pack you like. Hope this helped a bit. Thank you for responding!

I'm not using any external speakers or headphones, but I did try plugging in some earphones and found that I could hear it. It's just the external speaker that's an issue. I think it being a hardware issue might be a reality 😔 

If I turn up my volume to max, I can hear a very faint sound, like the sound you'd hear on an old TV when slowly rewinding a VHS tape?

As for the icons, I did have a custom icon pack and didn't have any luck finding one that would remove the backgrounds on certain stubborn apps, like Chrome or YouTube. But I did install Nova as I found you can create your own custom ones, so I think I'll just image edit the icons myself and place it as a custom one if I can't find anything on these new launchers.. Ah okay, could just be that the speaker doesn't play low frequencies well. Good luck on your customisation journey.. I couldn't quite put my finger on the word to describe how the sound changed when I listened on headphones/TV, knowing it's frequency helps too!

404,Question About LG X Charge,h8ms06,2020-06-14 03:57:50,"Hi! Sorry if this is a dumb question, I've been Googling and can't find the information I need. 

I live in America, use Cricket Wireless, and I have an LG X Charge purchased December 2018 and running Android 7.0. I just need to know whether or not this is a 64-bit device. Niantic, the company behind Pokemon Go, is [dropping support for 32-bit phones](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/11/pokemon-go-is-dropping-support-for-32-bit-android-phones/) at the beginning of August. It may seem inconsequential, but Pokemon Go has become a huge part of my life over the past year and a half. It's the main way my partner and I make time to spend with each other, a way we can go out and enjoy ourselves without spending money, and the cornerstone of our main group of friends. So losing access to it would be a pretty big personal blow, and I want to know if I can keep my current phone (which is just chugging along no problem, wasn't even going to replace it until next year at the earliest) or if I should start saving up now for a new one.

I'm on a super strict budget, so my phone was deliberately pretty low-end. I checked the specs of it to try to figure it out, and the LG X Charge does appear to have a 64-bit processor. But, I was told to use AIDA64 and look for ""x64"" or ""-64"" in the kernel version, and I was told my phone would not be 64-bit if it wasn't there. It isn't, which just confused me. If it's that my phone is 64-bit but my current OS isn't, is there a way that I could get my current OS to be 64-bit, or am I just out of luck? Thanks so much in advance! 

[Link to AIDA 64 Kernel Information/""About Phone --> Software"" Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/jdJA6oP)",1,0.6,3.0,"AIDA64 is detecting ARMv7, which should be using 32bit. Anyway, there's no easy way to do ""convert"" a 32bit OS installation to 64bit. It's kernel level. You basically need a custom kernel for that and probably a custom ROM. The issue here is that, there isn't even a section on XDA for the X Charge, there's no root for it nor bootloader unlock. So it's pretty much stuck in 32bit. You'll need a new phone.  
Also, be wary when buying. There are a bunch of cheaper phones now that still use 32bit OS.. According to the device specs on any site, the Xcharge has a 64 bit processor.

https://www.devicespecifications.com/en/model/ecf9442e

But from your own screenshots, it's definitely running a 32bit version of Android.

Unfortunately, such devices cannot run 64 bit versions of Android but you have an even bigger problem.
Cricket do not allow any of their devices to be bootloader unlocked, so even if there was a way to flash a 64 bit version of Android via a custom ROM (and there's not) you can't unlock the bootloader on your device to even attempt such.
There's no workaround.

I'm sorry to say you are currently ""out of luck"" with this device, and please don't be afraid to ask such questions, as there's been a flood of posts about 32 bit devices since Pokémon go announced this change.

Arm 32 bit versions are eventually going to be phased out completely anyway, so you could see this as an early opertunity to change devices.

Little bit of advice - As you live in the US, do not buy devices locked to a US network, as they may be cheaper in the short term but you give up any right to customise the device later on as all network locked devices in the US cannot be bootloader unlocked, so custom ROMs and root will be impossible.
There's no hacks or workarounds either.

Also avoid ALL US Snapdragon chipped Samsungs - especially the A10 and A10E (they are both 32 bit) as they cannot be bootloader unlocked either, and European / Chinese Exynos chipped Samsung's WILL NOT WORK in USA.

The best cheap 64 bit devices available these days are the Moto G7 Power, the Moto E6 plus, Nokia 2.3 and 5.3 and the Xiaomi Redmi 8 - all under £150 in uk ($188)
There are many others, just make sure you check the CPU architecture before making any future purchase.. Thank you. I appreciate the information.",402.0,5,303,1

try this or nice catch. Interesting. That does look like a legit message at first glance.

Have you recently used a device that isn't your S8. Could be your pc/laptop logged in with your Google account? First time I've heard of this so not entirely sure.

Do you have another Samsung device like a tablet that you have a Samsung account signed in?

At the very very worst case and I hate when people suggest this, do a factory reset if you are really worried and if you're comfortable doing so, list which apps you install.. This is the only Samsung device I own. And since I don't really know what the issue is, I'm also not really sure if the factory reset would solve it but I guess later on today I might actually do it. I'll give you an update!. Before you do that it also couldn't hurt to review what third party apps have access to your primary account as well as which devices.

How do i patch the boot.img file before flashing to phone?  I know of Magisk but this needs to be installed on the phone and it only patches the current boot.img installed on the phone not one on a computer before loaded to phone.

Sorry to sound like an idiot. I have rooted a phone before ( Moto X Pure )
and it worked well.
This phone tho is newer and uncharted territory for me. There were programs and such for the X Pure
when i did it. This seems to be a command (adb) process only.

Finally, is there a different logo.img I can use ( I assume this is the boot animation file). Is this done via adb commands? 

I honestly do not want to brick this phone by being stupid. When I had my other phone TWRP was a breeze but this phone will not work with TWRP.

 It is the time to start Magisk Manager v7.5.1 on XT2027-3 and choose Patch Boot Image File option to create the magisk_patched Boot Image File.

I don't know if it works on Huawei but this works great for me. https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/gtpkja/any_reason_call_recorder_apps_stopped_working_on/.

I have a OnePlus phone and figured out how to enable the hidden call recording function.. Make sure you live in a place where such activities are legal.
Where I live, you need either a court order or both parties to consent to the recording for it to be legal.. Try some call recording apps. Sadly it was never official, so only a few (or none) might work for you, in some cases.

I've noticed that ""Cube"" call recorder is the only one that worked on my Pixel 4 Android 10. Before I used ""BoldBeast"" or ""ACR"".

If none work, try rooting the device and then try again, and start with BoldBeast because it seems they have tons of workarounds, especially for rooted devices.. Not really what you asked but you could use an automation app to just block all calls from people not on your contact list. Won't matter how many times he changes his number then.. Root your phone.

Some. Phones have call recorder installed - but hidden until you root.. The usual neckbeard tech responses here - ""root your phone!""

&#x200B;

No, sorry.  If you want to record phone calls, you need to give the application permissions to write to your storage.  That's why the app asks for access to everything and the kitchen sink.A) because it needs to read and write to the disk and B) because most Android apps are shitty programs selling your data for advertising to make money so they usually just ask for blanket access.  They're not spying on you per se, that's how they aggregate the data.

421,Why does Qualcomm have a monopoly in the US?,h8fuxp,2020-06-13 21:06:29," I've tried looking into why Qualcomm has a monopoly on mobile chipsets in the US. All I've gotten so far is it has to do with patents and some anti-trust lawsuit. But I haven't been able to find anything more in depth. What's to stop phone manufacturers from making their own processors, like Samsung does with Exynos, or just choosing a different brand than Qualcomm? I realize there are exceptions, but it seems to be in the minority, as almost all Android phones have a Snapdragon chipset.",1,0.67,10.0,"Qualcomm doesn't have a monopoly. Other mobile chipset manufacturers include Mediatek, Samsung, Huawei and Apple. 

There are many reasons why Qualcomm chipsets are predominant in the US. One reason is that the US has CDMA cellular networks (Verizon and Sprint), while most other countries use only GSM networks. Qualcomm holds patents related to CDMA. Once CDMA networks are retired, which will happen over the next few years, then there may be more competition.

Qualcomm chipsets also happen to provide a good balance of performance, cost, and battery life.. The costs are prohibitive. Nothing is 'keeping' another company from entering the market, but the costs are astronomical. Plus the big boys already have deals in place with the fabs to actually manufacturer the chips, and they get top billing in regards to their place in line.

Intel has their own fabs, and it would be great if they would make a solid push into the mobile space. However they can't seem to get their shit together (14+++++++ nm die process).. Samsung is working with AMD to produce even better mobile processors, but we won't see those for awhile. > What's to stop phone manufacturers from making their own processors

Nothing, but why put the effort in when Qualcomm already makes good products? Samsung has Exynos but they don't even release those variants in North America for some reason.

MediaTek and HiSilicon also make mobile SoCs but in general they suck compared to Qualcomm offerings and most people in North America aren't fans of Chinese smartphone products because they are linked to spying.. Here's one reason:
""Estimates put the cost of building a new fab over one billion U.S. dollars with values as high as $3–4 billion not being uncommon. TSMC invested $9.3 billion in its Fab15 300 mm wafer manufacturing facility in Taiwan. The same company estimations suggest that their future fab might cost $20 billion.""

On top of that is the R&D, engineering, etc. So even if you outsourced manufacturing to someone like TSMC it's expensive to jump in the market and get to that point.. So basically it's cheaper than making your own processor? That makes me curious why Samsung almost never uses Exynos in their US variants, even though international models do.. MTK SOCs are great for low cost phones, they are pretty good with open source I believe.. Because to put Exynos in US phones they have to pay for Qualcomm antennae for CDMA compatibility. Why spend for an Exynos chip+Qualcomm antenna, when you can just spend for a Qualcomm chip with the integrated antenna tech? The only time they put Exynos in a US phone was for the S6 because the Snapdragon 810 was such a fire in a way worse than the Exynos 990 is today. Snapdragon did bounce back beautifully though.. I think one reason is CDMA, which is used in the US. The Exynos CPUs don't support it.. Oh so that's the patent everyone it referring to.  I did also know about the whole modem situation, but I was unaware that it's more cost effective to just use the whole Qualcomm package.",509.0,9,88,1

Then you can flash LOS to your phone. This may void your warranty and if you aren't careful, brick your phone.

Then, if you unlocked bootloader, see if there are custom ROMs for your phone on XDA, and follow instructions for it.

If there are none, you can try [Project Treble](github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki). Really interesting project I've recently stumbled upon.. Thanks for this. I spoke to Huawei who told me that the highest version my phone takes is the one I have (even though new versions were released not long after I bought it).

443,Android vs IOS differences,h8akfh,2020-06-13 16:24:11," 

**Update after finishing writing the post\***

**This was supposed to be a short question if someone has a text in favor of android against IOS that explains good, why we you should choose an android phone and not an iphone, but combine my Ritalin and my pretty fast typing, and you shall get a super long text about why I don't like iphone users as people, what do I think of tiktok and how I learned my English. if you have 3 minutes your welcome to read. I think it's worth it lol.**

Hello my fellow android users!

I am not too deep in rooting my phone or something, but I use an android. Now, I have tried an iphone, and did not like using it. the OS is just bad.. There are a lot of reasons to choose an android over an iphone, but when I try to write them.. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I can't do it.

I live in Israel (Don't Involve Politics Please...) and In Israel, if you don't have an iphone you're basically a loser.

Apple took over in the subject of phones. It drives me nuts when someone who doesn't know anything just tells someone to buy an iphone and to throw that phone in the the bin.

I am not hating on Apple but I do hate like, 90% of their users. What I find is that the people with iphones are always the basic people, sometimes I find them just less intellgient (At least in my state) Not because they are using an iphone but I feel like it says A LOT about their personality, just basic people. I also seriously find the people who use reddit in Israel (not many) to be the same kind of people who use an android.. like, it's hard to explain but that's just how it is.

Also, most of the people who use TikTok are that type of iphone people! just, less smart... idk.. I often see a video on there that shows something that I understand how it is done, or that is fake or false and no one in the comment section is getting it.. For example:

""The man who didn't eat in 40 years, and is still alive!!"" and the whole comment section is like WHATTTT how?? so cooll!!

And it's obviously not possible.. I would give many better examples but I can't think of anything right now.

And about tiktok, I do use it and I think it's a fun app, I know reddit hates tiktok but it can be really fun, the app is not bad, it's working great, and my first impression when trying it was, Ok that, that's not bad.. There are cool options, the app is smooth, works perfectly and I barely see room for improvement.

(That's if you are putting aside the crap optimization for filming with an android phone)

Oh and, to put the iphone vs android thing in perspective.. there is that kind of video with:

""ok (thumbs up) not ok (thumbs down)"" and there was one sound that girls In israel used (reacting to) and It was like, ""He is great and everything but he has bad teeth"" (like 70% of the girls made the sign of not ok)

He is great and everything but he is jealous (Most girls went with ok)

and then, ""He is great and everything but he uses a samsung"" (like 80% of the girls went with not ok)

(Not ok means not gonna want as a boyfriend)

I watched like the top 50 videos with this sound, and as I said, 80% of girls went with not ok.

This. This is the type of a personality I am talking about.

It's just like, I imagine the girl I would date in the future to be from the type of people who use an android.. I don't know how to explain it. Maybe it is just in my state, I don't really know. Maybe what iphones has become made the group of people that do use an android to like, belong to that group of people? (Which I seem to like more and want to be friends with) (Not that I hate my mom or sister who owns an iphone but you probably get what I'm saying)

Anyway, there's a dude in my class who has an iphone 11 Pro and basically acts like he a king, and he thinks there is absolutely nothing that is close to his phone in terms of, like, begin a good phone, you know. In the mind of most people today in the community in my state android=garbage (Oh and also they say iphones vs samsung, they do not know about the existence of other android phones)

I feel like I need to write a text with the benefits of an android phone over an iphone, And I truly believe there are many, but I just can't seem to ducking do it. I need to send it to him, and to know it in generel lol.

Does anybody have like a text about that? I'd love to have a link to it.

Android is great, it's better in my opinion but although I believe there are many good things to it, I can't find more than 3 words to say. I really need that for an argument, Please ? :)

Oh and again, not hating on Apple, when they do things, they often make them just magically. and they did develop some cool stuff.

Sorry if there were English mistakes, I don't listen to the teacher in my English class since about 6th grade. I am learning mostly from browsing the web\\Playing Minecraft (No joke) And I am Still better than all of the kids in my class. I needed to speak and type in English since the first day I bought Minecraft, and from begin very bad at English and needing help after school I am now the best in class, I am in 9th grade and I feel like only now I am starting to get homework that's not super easy for me and some words that I actually don't really know yet. So, the English is Minecraft based. Blame them!",9,0.7,18.0,"Is there a question somewhere in there?. Just don't bother. If you want an Android, get an Android. If the other person will judge you because of your phone choice, then that person isn't worth your time.. Lol I can relate to the Ritalin and long paragraphs of typing. I'm prescribed Adderall myself and I've had times where I'm texting a friend shortly after taking my meds and soon enough I'm going on essay-level tangents about something. 

I've been using Android since I got my first smartphone, and I strongly prefer it. I've tried an iPhone and I don't think I could ever switch to it because they lack so many things on Android that I find to be essential. 

That being said, I can honestly understand why a lot of people favor iPhones. I've always been around more tech savvy people in my life, among my friends and family the vast majority of them are fairly competent with technology, even the less inclined people I know are very familiar with the basics and know their way around their phones/computers at a basic level. The thing is, after working electronics retail I realised how far from the norm that is. The vast majority of people don't care about their tech, they just want to call, text, video call, listen to music and go social media, and they don't want to replace the thing unless they absolutely have to because it doesn't interest them, they just wanna buy one that will continue to function for years because they don't WANT a new one and in general they aren't going to be excited for most new features aside from cameras looking better. 

iPhones provide exactly that. They're simple to use and you basically can't fuck them up or make it do something you don't want it to do accidentally. They also tend to last a long time, so while they're more expensive up front they tend to still work fairly well for years. I've seen people still using an iPhone 6s and even once saw someone still using their iPhone 4 and they ran pretty smoothly still. I'm sure they needed a battery replacement at some point but they otherwise still kept up and didn't feel sluggish. 

Reddit in general consists of more nerds, its just the nature of it considering it's a social media platform that's centered around topics instead of the users. especially on this subreddit, you're not gonna find many of the average users who just want a working phone, you're going to see the users who look into these things more in depth, comparing screen refresh rates in Hz and battery capacities in mAh, things that your average user won't know, or even generally won't care about. if you ask an average person what it means to have a screen run in 90Hz they'll look at you like you just asked them to describe nuclear physics. And that's not even a bad thing, necessarily, they're just not nerds, they don't care about these things, they just want their phone to work. You're not going to win these people over by telling them how great the customization is and how you can set different apps as your default because they won't understand why you'd go out of your way to download a different web browser or messaging app than the one that comes with your phone. 

Most of what Android does better are things that average users would never bother with and Apple has done a great job at making, and marketing their devices to users who just generally aren't super into technology. And when an iPhone user does try an Android, since they hear Android is so much cheaper, they go with a budget model of something like a Motorola, or a 4-5 generations old Samsung, and when it turns out to be terrible, they assume that's the Android experience as a whole and not just that they bought a shitty phone because unlike iPhones, Android isn't really standardized in any way. The latest Pixel and latest Galaxy will be very different from one another in tons of ways and if you don't research you won't know what ways that is, and oftentimes this group of people isn't interested enough to research, they want what they know works for them and they want what they know they like 

I guess my point is, you're probably not going to actually convince any of these people of anything unless they're nerds for technology because for them it boils down to: easy to use, good camera, iMessage, and it looks nice. That's it. I gave up on that whole argument years ago when I realized I'm just not the target audience for an iPhone, they're made with the average user in mind first and foremost. And anyone giving you shit for what kind of phone you have is either immature or intensely shallow so they're not worth your time anyways. Wow, t'is quite the wall of text!

I don't have any long text, just adding my two cents.

There are many shortcomings in ios that would annoy me, like the lack of customizability and not having a file manager for a long time.

But there where some usability/user experience hickups that really surprised me when using a friends iphone.
E.g: No access to the actual settings via the quick settings menu? Really?

or

* Some setting greyed out because energy saving mode is on *

JUST TURN THE F*ING ENERGY SAVING MODE OFF AUTOMATICALLY INSTEAD OF COMPLETELY BLOCKING THE SETTING!!!


And while the ignorance is just as strong where I live, at least the attitude isn't as bad. Luckily. I have no problem with anyone using an iphone, but idiots feeling special for it can sure get me in a rage.

Stay strong, fellow philandroidist! :). !remind me tomorrow. I'm just here to say that:

Android vs iOS is a win for Android in terms of software, versatility, etc, at least for me.

Android phones vs iPhones is like saying ""Whats better? Ferrari or all the other luxury sports cars?

There is only one iPhone and there are thousands of Android phones.

This comparisons are pointless. Unless you compare an specific iPhone model to another specific Android phone model.. The best analogy I have is:

Android: traveling the world

iOS: never leaving your hometown. Don't worry about their opinion, but also do not argue and keep it cool. I advise you to get yourself an Android, it's gonna be a pretty good phone - especially Samsung 😉. I think the question is

Does anyone have a link to an article about the pros of buying android over iPhone?. Dam that's long.   
Yeah, you sum it up really good, I agree with almost all you said. I guess I am just a nerd and most of the people with iphones are really just the opposite.. That makes perfect sense thinking about it now.. Really perfect sense. I'd love to have nerdy friends like me :(  I like building pcs and technology and phones and all the around but have pretty much nobody to talk to about it.

Interesting... I see. OP - if you like Android, just get it and don’t worry about what other people think?

There are a ton of articles and forum posts here and everywhere (basically) that outlines the the pros and cons of each platform. Still, if your goal is to prove to your friends that Android is better than iPhone (when they are already committed to iPhone) that might drive a wedge in your friendship. I’m not a big fan of group messages so I don’t get the hype around iMessage. I use an iPhone and when I message someone on Android it sent via SMS — that isn’t a big deal.. >Dam that's long

Yeah, amusingly the Adderall ramblings that I mentioned in the first line happened here lmao got a little carried away but theres just a lot of little things that are all small realisations on the topic that I've had.

 I used to feel apple stuff was just overpriced garbage and that people using it were stupid for paying a premium just to have something that does less than I got for less money, but in reality it's just that their devices are quite good for their intended audience and as far as phones are concerned I've just never been in that category. 

Amusingly I've actually started to come to like some of Apple's products and software a lot once I started using them. As a pet project I converted my PC to a dual-boot Windows/Hackintosh, originally because I felt I'll likely need to learn to use Apple stuff for my career and it would be good to have hands on experience, and I actually ended up liking the OS a lot, which lead to me getting an iPad and apple pencil and also loving those. 
As far as phones though, I won't be switching to an iPhone without some serious changes being made to iOS that I just can't see happening and I have a OnePlus 7 Pro that they'll have to pry from my cold dead hands lmao. It's gonna take a seriously impressive phone even on Android's side of things to get me to switch from this thing

>I like building pcs and technology and phones and all the around but have pretty much nobody to talk to about it.

I totally get that, it sucks to not be able to really share your hobbies and passions as much with your friends and people around you but if you look in the right places you can definitely meet like-minded people to talk about these things with. I don't get the whole deal with this  iMessage. is it instead of whatsapp? 

like, all the people I know only use whatsapp.. I don't think anyone knows what is even iMessage.. (In my area) 

&#x200B;

Anyway thanks sir. Yeah, iMessage is the USA version of Whatsapp. On an iPhone, if you are texting other iPhone users, you can chat over iMessage. This means that you get Whatsapp-like features (end-to-end encryption, reactions, read receipts, etc) on those chats. When you send a message to someone else with iMessage, the speech bubble color of your chat is blue. If they don't have an iPhone, the color will be green (indicating SMS). The issue with that is SMS is an inferior experience than iMessage, and many android users are discriminated against due to the ""green bubble"".

Since SMS has been unlimited in the United States (unlike other countries where it's been more expensive), it's stuck around as the norm. Since iPhone users now can chat over iMessage on top of SMS, there's really no reason for them to download another app. Even though Android users have more chat apps, iPhone users don't.

My philosophy on the whole Android-vs-iOS thing is this: People can buy and use whatever phone they want--it's not up to me to dictate what they want. However, discriminating against people with other operating systems is wrong. It's happened to me several times that someone tries to text me and says ""Oh, you don't have an iPhone"". If others don't like the standard SMS experience, either download and use another chat app (Whatsapp, Instagram DMs, Signal, GroupMe, etc) or stop complaining. Nobody should feel bad about the phone they bought.. Pretty much but 2 corrections: iMessage and SMS always have worked in concert on the platform. When sending a message if iMessage isn’t available, it has always fallen back to SMS (for phone numbers as addresses).

Also, iOS has every chat app that I know about. What messenger app is it missing? WhatsApp, facebook messenger, google hangouts, Microsoft teams, etc etc etc are all on iOS.. Yeah--I think that seamless integration is part of the problem. Since texting someone with iMessage is the exact same process as texting someone with SMS (i.e. open the Messages app and type in a phone number), the attitude has shifted. People have come to expect iMessage features everywhere (because they are integrated into the normal texting experience) and that causes them to discriminate against Android users.

As far as other apps goes, it is true that alternate, cross-platform chat apps exist on both sides. However, it's not a tech problem anymore--it's a social one. Getting people to download and use a new chat app sounds a little rude (i.e. ""You have to download an entirely new app just for the privilege of messaging me"") and most iPhone will say that ""normal texting just works"". While other chat apps do exist, people just don't want to download them.",2166.0,4,1021,1

449,[Help] My mum's LG Rebel 4 shr uses through Simple Mobile upon bringing it home yesterday after an outing with my sister no longer connects to the network nor shoes it has a SIM or / IMEI number which I need to talk to her provider for help. What could have happened?!,h89epk,2020-06-13 15:17:51,"Hi all!

I've never had to post here and hope I am in the right place. But I am completely lost on how to fix my mums phone after exhausting the only ways I know of solving such an issue. 

So, long ass story as short as possible. 

My mum has an LG Rebel 4 bought through Simple Mobile as a gift. Not what I would have gotten her but I have an impulsive sister I'd like to murder right now. 

Yesterday she left and the phone was working fine. I even called her on her outing to see how she was. 

Jump three hours and I call to check on her again and get her voicemail. I now assume the battery suddenly died or my moronic sibling intentionally powered off the device. 

One hour later she comes home. I said I tried to reach her multiple times but she never got any calls and the phone was ON. 

What I found wrong and tried

She has no connection to her network. No data usage what so ever. It would not even let me turn the data properly on. It says on but I have no access to APN ( which I first thought was the issue because she never updates her phone and that was what I was trying to do as it has happened to me before). No success. Also can not update at all even when connected through WiFi. 

It can no longer  receive calls or make them nor can it send texts or receive them. Just suddenly?

So I have decided to call Simple Mobile which I am about to do but they asked in the prompts for the IMEI number. When I went to the Info for her phone there is no number listed where it is supposed to show the phone number connected to the device;  it also says ""Network Unknown"" and I briefly received a message I believe saying it could not fins the SIM (It came and went quickly.)

I have not tried a factory reset because it says all data in the phone will be lost but my concern is that if I do that all info about the phone will be erased from when I entered it to set up the phone in December. 
This is also a last resort and I have never had to do it with any of my phones or devices before. I am as you can tell not well versed in this kind of tech, I am in other areas but phones have always baffled me.

If any of this makes sense to one or some of you, any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

How does this happen in the course of 4 hours?! I don't even understand it. It seems ludicrous to me. My mum is also not tech savvy and does not ""mess about"" with anything she doesn't know how to use properly first. Basically just the  browser and apps and such. 


Side note: Even as it is my mums phone my sister uses it when they are together almost daily. She deletes anything she does or tries to with little success. Could she have wiped or disconnected the phone from the network by accident?",1,1.0,5.0,"For the IMEI number, go to the phone dialer and dial *#06# or find the about phone section in the settings(unless that was where you already looked).

It is also possible that the SIM card failed or has been dislodged. Try powering off the phone, taking out the SIM card and reinserting the SIM card. If the SIM card failed, it will need replaced.. When I dialed the code you gave me I received a message saying ""IMEI null"" 

Im guessing a new SIM or upgrade in phone will be in order.. Thank you.  I will do what you suggested first. 

I don't know how I can access the SIM when the battery cant be removed so I don't know how to get inside where it is.. If tampering might be a possibility, your phone could be in field test mode.

Try this, in the dialer type *#197328640# or \*#*#197328640#\*\#*

If you get a prompt then select ""common"" it is usually option 6 and then find FTM probably option 1.

If FTM is on, then turn it off and restart the phone. Check if your IMEI number is back.. Thank you. No success but I appreciate giving it a go. This is so peculiar and absurdly random. The only rational  answer I have is my sibling and possibly her bf were on it whilst with my mum. I can always tell. 

Perhaps the wisest choice is putting her on my plan with a basic mobile keeping it locked to high heaven. 

I just cant believe something (to me) so complicated occurred out of nowhere and months of no problems. But alas, everything has glitches I suppose.

When I restart the phone the apps can run normally in the background but after some time they stop doing so. In example I use a lot of youtube and instagram, I play something on youtube then switch to instagram, then back to youtube and it gives me the home page instead of the video that I was watching.

1. Publish in your github repo, the full and proper playstore ID of your app
2. Publish in your github repo, the public key cert used to sign your app in playstore
3. Publish in your github repo, the full APK of your app via releases mechanism

\#1 is the simplest but isn't really cryptographically hardended.  Just makes sure the users type in the same URL you tell them to and hope there is no DNS hijack other exploits at play.

\#2 is nice since it is trivial to extract the signing cert from an installed APK and the cert fingerprint can be verified against the one in the source repo.  The signing cert never (or should never) changes so there is little maintenance this creates.  And finally, most any JDK / ADK install will be able to verify an APK against a given cert.

\#3 is probably the most complete since the user can checksum their installed APK against the one in the source repo, or simply install the one listed in the source repo.  This does put extra work on the developer since they need to remember to publish a release via github whenever they push a releast to Google.

I know it's paranoid, but there are some bitcoin Android apps that might warrant a heightened sense of paranoia.

Yet I don't want my data to be stolen or a virus on my phone.

Nova, lawnchair, Microsoft and smart launcher 5 the most popular right now.

Notice I didn't say ""best""

As far as I'm concerned, no launcher is better than another, what device you have and what android version it has is far more important than concerns about your data or viruses.
Get over it, your fears are completely unfounded if you plan to use a third party launcher.
Theres no risk.


There's more risk from installing a launcher that's not compatible with your device.
Help us to help you by listing your device details as some devices have quite serious issues using certain launchers, and your failure not to disclose that information here helps no one, including you.. I'd personally recommend Nova Launcher.

After using the free version for a short while, I bought the pro version and have never looked back. It's been the only launcher I've ever been thoroughly satisfied with. So much so that haven't so much as tested any other launchers in nearly 5 years.

There may be better, or equal, launchers out there but this is the only one I can speak to personally, but I definitely try to share it as often as possible. It's incredibly customizable, well regarded, and really stable. Some people have told me they felt it was too customizable and confusing, but I didn't find that to be the case myself. 

Definitely worth trying.. I feel like I've just been explained the heat death of the universe. Thank you.. If you want to use customisation apps, you will have to give your device certain permissions to use such.
A launcher alone cannot customise your home screen.
Wallpapers, widgets, and icon packs will usually be involved in creating a nice home screen.
This is where things can get a little murky if you are not careful.
Always use playstore or apkpure, and whilst I appreciate nowhere is 100 per cent safe, those places are much safer than the rest.

And again, I urge you not to get so ""triggered"" and melodramatic about your fears. 

If those things concern you so much, Stop using google chrome and google search on your device if you have such data and virus fears.
I use Quant and bromite, theres nothing google on my device at all.

This can't possibly be harder than extracting the password from system files for something you seem to need handy.. Signal has a note to self. I put a lot of stuff like wifi passwords there.

That said, your phone should be autoconnecting to known networks so you don't have to know the password.

Any suggestions or advice? Thanks.",1,1.0,5.0,"S10. It depends really

Pros of the S10 Lite:

If you use TWS or other Bluetooth earphones primarily then the lack of headphone jack and larger battery help with the Bluetooth connection. If you have issues with your palm accidentally pressing the screen (if you have smaller hands maybe) then the flat screen could help

Pros of the S10 Plus:
If you're often around environments where water or dust is a concern, then the IP rating could be very beneficial. If you're an audiophile then the headphone jack is definitely going to be a benefit with Samsung's SoundAlive and it has a more than decent DAC. 

For screen resolution I would say it's personal preference. Having used larger screen and bezelless phones for a while, I personally don't notice the difference in resolution on anything above 720p unless going from 1080p to 4k.

3. Enable USB Debugging on your phone. 

4. Connect your phone to your pc via a USB cable and locate ADB Driver folder which you downloaded earlier and run Universal ADB Driver app. It will automatically detect your phone. Now install USB Drivers. 

5. Now go to platform tools folder and open command prompt window here. 

6. Now enter the following commands and after each command press Enter. 
   i) adb devices 
   ii) adb shell
   iii) pm uninstall -k --user 0 name of package

Note :- replace ' name of package' with the package name which you have noted at the 1st step. 

7. By now you would have able to remove the system apps.

Moto Z4

OnePlus 6T",0,0.5,2.0,"The G8+ is objectively worse than the other 3 (64GB, plastic back/frame instead of glass/aluminum, no Gorilla Glass, Android 9 only) but other than that it's really down to what you find most important.

Feature wise the Pixel and OnePlus are slightly ahead of the Z4 (which is the most expensive), but I personally prefer Moto's ambient display over the Pixel. (Haven't used the OnePlus, but I don't think AMOLED lets you use ambient display?) And the Pixel is noticeably smaller than the other two. The Pixel's camera is probably the best of the three, yet has the lowest resolution if you're a pixel-counter. The OnePlus in several areas is the best (highest test scores on things like graphics performance, processor speed, battery) but the Pixel is cheaper and isn't that far behind.. It depends on what you need out of it really. 

The G8+ should have some pretty great battery life if that's a major concern and a fairly clean build of Android (stock with some nice features). Also has some great audio quality

The Z4 is the one I wouldn't recommend off the list. It's kind of a jack of all trades, but not as good in any area as the others, with everything it does well, another of your choices does better and more 

The Pixel will have the best camera and be supported the longest + monthly security patches. If you can get it, I'd recommend trying to find the XL model though, as the 3 was notably lacking in the battery life department

The 6T is phenomenal software wise with a decent update schedule and can use GCam to take some pretty great photos. Oxygen OS usually has a great battery life as well and under display fingerprint scanners are really convenient

I bought a ""new"" oneplus 7 pro from a chinese reseller.  
After opening the box I immediately understood that the phone was actually refurbished (marks showing the box was already opened, charging cable not nicely packed, with signs of previous use).  
The phone is in pristine condition so I see no real problem here.

The problems came later. The phone was already booted and waiting for me to start with the setup. I set it up, everything worked fine, until I tried to start netflix which told me the phone was not compatible. I wandered around on the internet and saw that it may mean that it has been rooted or the bootloader has been unlocked. I'm not too bad with IT but I've never rooted any of my mobile devices so it's a bit outside my domain of expertise. I also saw that GPay doesn't work on devices with bootloader unlocked so I tried to set it up and it failed.

At that point I rebooted the phone, and I saw the start-up warning that the bootloader is unlocked on this phone.

Is there a way that I can put everything back as factory-settings?

The one thing I struggled with a bit is that I hadn't understood that you had to perform the oem lock when the phone was in the bootloader menu (the terminal-like boot menu before starting the OS).

A lot of people don't understand this and think clearing your cache frees up usable space. It doesn't.. What kind of phone (make/model)?. [Blast](https://youtu.be/elA6WDvKGG0) your cache. Ah, I've been having a similar issue with my phone for months. I don't have a cleaning app apart from Files by Google which is good for identifying duplicate files and junk data but can't clear cache. Usually, I clear apps cache through the phone's settings. It gives you a nice list of all the apps. However, some apps still have cache that isn't cleared. One time, Spotify had occupied over 1 GB on my phone. For such apps, you have to clear the cache from the app settings. Don't know if this helps.. I think the guys over here didn't even understood your main problem!!!
Your main problem is not cache, but it's huge amount of cache developed in no time!!... I too had same problem once in my old phone... And was really fed up of it.... Nothing helped... Had to reset my phone to get rid of this problem. It will build up again and cache is important. Get an external sd card or clear some space by uninstalling apps or deleting useless files. Else no other options.. Figure out which app(s) are creating the massive cache and go from there. Find some other way to get space on your phone, you cannot fight cache unless you uninstall the apps that is causing it.

700MB is nothing. On my phone Chrome uses 800MB and Adobe Clip used 900MB+. Unless an app is giving you trouble, there is no reason to clear your cache that often.. Install CCleaner. Hi man, I use CCleaner, been using it on my PC when I had a PC and now on my Android, very good program!

Give it a try!. How it doesn't? Sometimes I go to the store to install something and it says there is no space, I clean the cache then it's able to install. >think clearing your cache frees up usable space. It doesn't.

This is patently false.. Huawei honor 7x. Thanks,I use the cleaner that comes with the phone from the company,It's not a third party cleaner and that's good

Have you figure out what is creating this much cache in such a short period?. Google Files does NOT clear cache of system apps, including Chrome and Play Store/Services.. Finally someone. That's not my problem,previously it was creating more cache but in more time, my problem now is that it's making a lot in a very short period of only few minutes. It takes a lot of space, +700Mb is a lot for me,my phone is almost full,64Gb phone. I heard that it's bad? Idk maybe it's safety? I don't remember. CC cleaner is a scam program that doesn't nessisarly do anything that you can't already do, and it also deletes needed registry files sometimes.

CC cleaner for your phone is arguably more useless because sense Android like 7+ you've had native features that do similar tasks in your storage settings.. It's temporary. Obviously it takes time for the cache to build up again.. You have found out for yourself that ""it doesn't free usable space"" is wrong. I don't know why apps cling to their temporary files when they close. Is it related to the fact that Android typically keeps part of an app loaded in memory (RAM) when a user ""closes"" the app? I don't know, but it's irritating, isn't it? :-). What do you mean?. Ah! For a second, I thought this said, ""Huawei horror."". Nah, I never did. Sorry.. That's true.. Bump. Maybe bcoz of OTA update. And let me make it clear that clearing cache without any reason is not a good practice, you are putting more pressure on your phone by making it do the same thing again and again. Cache are one of the best things and are extremely useful, let your system do whatever its doing.. Android is designed to operate this way, you should look into other options like offloading pics/vids to the cloud or investing in an SD card.. If your phone is almost full, instead of worrying about 700mb of cache, maybe you should worry about what is taking up the other 90% of your storage.. Yeah, was breached and patched since! Android version wasn't if I recall correctly!

I dunno, I defo don't want to use any Chinese shit that is swarming on Google Play!. Well, I won't argue, but I can't delete cache on Android 9, there's simple no button to delete all the useless cache from all the apps altogether, even Android 5 has this option!

You'd have to go through every app and delete app's cache!

I've just checked, couldn't find anything, free up space button leads to some bs and there's no delete cache option!. Yeah that's is my problem,it doesn't take much time and it takes a lot of space. Cache is made up of files. Files and information cannot be stored in nothingness. In Android the files called ""Cache"" are stored in exactly the same place as apps, taking up mass storage space. This is why deleting apps' ""Cache"" frees room to install an app when space is running low.. It is taking a lot of space that I want. That only started recently. Your*

I want this 700Mb. And the other ""90%"". I use the one that came with the phone, It's from the company of the phone, it's not a third party cleaner. I can't speak for the cc cleaner on Android because I haven't really used it, or know fully what it deletes because Android is vastly different from windows. But yes if you want to delete your cache all in one cc cleaner is probably fine, there is not much you can fuck up on your phone like you could with windows.. Cache are the files that apps downloads to speed up the performance. Downloading files every time from internet is usually time consuming and requires bandwidth. So the apps store some of the data necessary. This way next time you load, it doesn't have to load from scratch.

Sure clearing cache does free up memory. But unless you don't use that app. It's cache will build up again and you'll back to square one. So yeah, deleting cache only frees memory temporarily. 

You can test it yourself. 

1. Clear reddit app cache.
2. Disconnect internet
3. Open the app (You'll barely anything will load)
4. Now connect back to internet and scroll through your feed for a while. 
5. Close the app and disconnect from wifi.
6. Now open app again. 

You'll notice that quite a lot of images will be loaded. All these images are probably stored in cache and grabbing them from memory is much faster than downloading them from internet.

Stop spreading false information. Downvote me if you want. But this information is available pretty much everywhere if you bothered to research.

*Ah yes, typical reddit. Downvoting actual information.*

You can look up this information everywhere. 
https://www.androidcentral.com/how-and-when-clear-app-cache-or-data-android

Also I am CE major.. Get an external sd card. Let the phone have what it needs to function properly.. 700MB is not a lot, dude. I keep 1GB only for boost for reddit so i don't have to load from internet again and again.. It's most likely some app doing it. Go through your apps and try to find which one constantly has a ton of cache.. Then you started using a cache heavy app like WhatsApp, etc.

Regardless, I gave you the answer, do with it what you will.. I see, ok!. Yeah, agreed, haven't been using a PC for almost 5 years, don't think that I ever will!

Hey, just found: Pie does not have a cache partition, hence there is no option to clear cache.

That's why clear all cache option was removed, so seems that only 3rd party app can do that so in my case it's a CCleaner, but yeah, it's otherwise useless for me, I'd rather have something more lighter for my cache deleting needs!

Android 9 is quite cool, but also fucked up in many other ways!. >Cache are the files that apps downloads to speed up the performance.

>Sure clearing cache does free up memory.

>deleting cache only frees memory

Take your own advice:

>**Stop spreading false information.**

>Also I am CE major.

Ooo! You are studying Computer Engineering? Maybe they will teach you, someday, the difference between *memory* (RAM) and *mass storage.* This is a concept we learned in **8th grade Math class. In the 1970s.**

At least, ""Cache are the files that apps downloads to speed up the performance,"" has some potentially true information in it. First, ""cache"" is not a plural word. A program's (app's) cache **is** composed of files used by the program, which yes, might have been downloaded by the app. The files are also *created* by the app.

In larger computers, like a desktop or notebook PC, program cache will be stored in RAM. This is why it helps to have several GB of RAM. I have never written or studied Android programs (apps). Still, I have no doubt they are capable of storing information temporarily in memory (RAM). However, recent Android devices might have as little as 1GB of RAM, as opposed to 4GB or more on a PC. So there is precious little room there to store information.

I can go on, but right now I'm deciding where to post something I already wrote. Don't come at me with this, ""Stop spreading false information,"" garbage.. How to go through them in a list? Instead of opening each one,because maybe there is an app that I don't use is doing this. I have whatsapp since day 1. I only recently got a update for Android 9, been really wanting Android 10, with a phone with type C 3.0 so I can out put hdmi to a screen. For the most part I've only really been using my phone through scrcpy which uses Android develop bridge to let me interact with my phone on my computer desktop with a mouse and keyboard. And it works well enough for me.

I was going to try to make a bigger switch the phone when I first bought it, thinking it would be like a fun toy but it feels more like a burden overtime. I am much more happy in a real Linux enviorment overall the only thing I miss is reddit is fun's layout (which is similar to old reddit) and you can't get that on desktop from what I can tell.. Great. Now you are just strawmaning my argument. 

All I said clearing cache doesn't mean magic free space. And you just went in separate way which has no link to your original argument. Bit salty?

Edit:

>> Sure clearing cache does free up memory. But unless you don't use that app. It's cache will build up again and you'll back to square one. So yeah, deleting cache only frees memory temporarily. 

> Ooo! You are studying Computer Engineering? Maybe they will teach you, someday, the difference between memory (RAM) and mass storage. This is a concept we learned in 8th grade Math class. In the 1970s.

RAM Random Access **Memory**. *Insert Surprised Pikachu Face*

I guess you weren't paying attention in that 1970s 8th grade class of yours.. Storage is also a memory.. Mmm, I see, I myself waiting for a new Lenovo Tablet with Android 10!

When I broke my both PC and Laptop I've already had my first tablet, so I decided to switch and been using tablets even since!

Have you tried a new Reddit, web version I mean, seems very cool, even on the tablet, but I know what you mean, the app is awesome! 😃. Maybe you can re-read our comments and look up ""straw man fallacy,"" if you can take any time away from your computer studies.

Going back to the start:

>think clearing your cache frees up usable space. It doesn't.

To reiterate: this is clearly, undeniably, *demonstrably* false.

*That* is the original argument, which *you did nothing to refute, while giving the appearance that you were refuting it,* the very definition of a straw man argument. Instead, you went on to prove that you do not know some of the most basic terms of computing.

Here, I give steps: Look at exact free storage space on Android thing. Clear app caches, hundreds of MB. Look again at storage space. Is bigger! Amazing! Also is proof that clearing cache frees usable storage space.

Edit: In my immediate previous comment I was refuting your suggestion that I am spreading ""false information,"" and showing that instead, you are doing that. Discussions with real people sometimes involve digressions and subtopics.. No.

Here,have a nice article from Kingston, renowned manufacturer of *computer memory:* https://www.kingston.com/us/community/articledetail/articleid/29685. Nice choice. I always liked Lenovo but that's because they're supporters of linux and offer some good laptops based around those operating systems.

Normally I would say you should always have a solid PC at home but Qualcomm has a great monopoly on arm processors right now and are producing some great hardware that is compatible to a PC. Some Microsoft surface tablets currently use arm processors. 

I mean obviously the TDPs are lower, and you can't maintain maximum clockspeed for more then like 5 minutes on a snapdragon but it's getting there. Occulus vr (Facebook) has a product that uses a snapdragon 835 which is a couple generation's old now. Traditionally you need a $1000 PC to play vr, but the lighter titles seem to work just fine on a arm processor.

I would say if you ever need Industry standard software like Cad, CS6, blender, davinchi resolve or something like that is when you really want to make that investment these days.. >Here, I give steps: Look at exact free storage space on Android thing. Clear app caches, hundreds of MB. Look again at storage space. Is bigger! Amazing! Also is proof that clearing cache frees usable storage space.

The free space which will go away once you start using your apps. The only true way to get space is to uninstall those apps. 

I can argue that even I can clear RAM by killing every single task. Does it really? No! Because I need those task in RAM to use apps.

also I just noticed that you misquoted me. What an ass thing to do.. >Edit: In my immediate previous comment I was refuting your suggestion that I am spreading ""false information,"" and showing that instead, you are doing that. Discussions with real people sometimes involve digressions and subtopics.

The reason why I called it false information is because the same reasoning is used by shitty cleaner apps on play store which makes people install unnecessary app and only slows down their device in the long term. Heck even I am guilty of doing it back in 2011 when I had my first Android phone.. This article is wrong on many points. [Here's](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tvACgwpdqos/T97uKaGXQ-I/AAAAAAAAAA4/pKu7Tobv4CQ/s280/Memory.bmp) the **standard** classification of memory.  

RAM also **stores** data, cache memory also **stores** data. Though for a very short time.

This is taught in middle school. No need to even search the internet. Just pick some kids computer book.. Ha, I remember when I've been very well versed in this kinda knowledge, processers and stuff and all the rest of it, not that I don't understand it now, just lost a track a long time ago!

Thanks for the info, interesting!

Nah, I mostly play Chess and whatnot stuff like Reddit, YouTube and so on, but when I've been making music, I needed a good PC which I had, Reason was my main program!. Right, giant manufacturer of RAM for many years is wrong. Just what do you think ""cache memory"" *is,* exactly?. There's probably some decent music apps on Google play by now. If not a 45 dollar pi board could probably run audacity just fine. They're fun little project computers, and you don't need much to dedicated tasks.

And I have also lost a lot of knowledge on the best computer parts. My computer is like 5 years old now and even back then the parts where out dated to be a cheap mid ranged PC  for that erra. 

If you really want to look into the future of processors the future is riscv, and open source.. Yes, there are a few very good ones, can make tunes just fine, surely not like Apple Apps, but still very decent!

Same here, even then my PC wasn't that good but did the job just fine! 😂

I got a really tricky one and I've spend hours trying to figure out what to do, though nothing worked so far.

**Basic Data**: 

* Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016)
* Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop)
* Security Patch 1. November 2017

**The Problem**: The device is unable to connect to Google thus I'm unable to access the PlayStore. This is necessary since Whatsapp refuses to work until I update it to a more recent version.

Also Ive pulled some Updates and they went through flawlessly, but the phone stayed on 5.1 (saying its all up-to-date), eventhough the Internet says the J3 is upgradable to 7.1

**What I tried**: First I was thinking about readding the Google account, so I focused on that part. I restarted the device, cleared the cache of PlayStore, GooglePlayServices (GPS) and Download-Manager. Since that wasn't working I deactivated the GPS and uninstalled all updates of it reseting it to the factory version in the process. Normally this is fine as there isn't any crucial data stored in the GPS-Data. But then things got really weird. When I activated it again I recieved permanent crash-notifications of GPS. Re-Adding the Google-Account was also impossible as it just stayed at the first ""please Wait""-Screen while spamming the crash-notifications.

At that point I decided its no use and would be easier to just backup all data and reset the phone. Even more so as there really isn't much data on the phone. Just Contacts, Pics and Whatsapp.

Backing up Pics and Contacts is easy enough, but I can't get a backup of whatsapp. I managed to access whatsapp by disabling all outgoing connections and turning back the date to a date where it was still working. Once inside I turned to settings>Chat>Chat Backup and hit ""Backup Now"". A few seconds later it said it wasn't able to backup the chats to drive (which is expected and perfectly fine, since I just want a local Backup). The time of the last backup also got adjusted to the current time. When I checked the local storage under Whatsapp\\Backups i just hat two backups called something with settings and something with stickers, both with less than 1MB, so definetly not the chats. While looking for the Chats I found something in Whatsapp\\Databases. There was a file called msgstore.something, however it had just 6MB. Way to small to contain all chats including all media.

So I was thinking, is there some way to pull a backup using for example adb or another feature of whatsapp or Android, or is all this data lost? Also can I assume the problem to be solved once I reset the phone or can I expect the error to persist?",1,1.0,0.0,notexthere,0.0,6,440,1

How do I get Google to understand that ""navigate home"" means I want driving directions to home?",0,0.5,10.0,"It asked to set Home, I did, it opened up Maps & showed me home. Works for me, although I use Waze mostly. You could do that, too. But that won't be ""speakable"" 100%. Probably.. Having the same issue, instead if starting maps it opens Google Home App. 
I tried different phrases like ""drive home"" etc but then I only get a Google search result. I am using a pixel 4 xl in Germany with English language/voice settings - Help!. Edit up top: Wait! How about, ""Okay, Google, navigate to [your address]!""

=====

Have you tried other wording?

Okay, Google, launch [Google] Maps and navigate to Home.

Okay, Google, I'm driving home.

Okay, Google, take me home.

Just some ideas. I can easily imagine they all have the same result.

I had a lovely,  rich Google Assistant experience on my new Galaxy A20 last month. I tried to get rid of the new crap I don't need and don't like. Finally I said, ""Okay, Google, how do I remove Google Assistant?"" It showed me the settings. I guess Google Assistant is still running. It just has a cleaner interface without so much crap at the bottom of the screen. Like my old Galaxy J7. Could it be that Assistant is assisting you too much?. I set my home long ago and it's been working fine until recently though. I would prefer not to download another navigation app since maps has worked well for me otherwise, but if this doesn't get fixed (and there's a voice control I could use, eg ""open Waze and navigate home""), I'll have to look into it.. Glad it's not only me. Let me know if you find a solution.. Oh good ideas, I'll try some of those! It's just much easier to say ""home"" than have to say my full address every time, but one of the others may work.

I like the idea of Google Assistant but I rarely actually use it, so you're right, might be time to disable it... As long as ok Google still works for things like this.. Yeah, I don't know how ""Google Assistant"" is different from (or the same as) whatever the heck I've been using when I say, ""Okay Google."" I *disabled* the ability to respond to that on my previous phone, and might do so on this one. I get very frustrated when I-- or someone else! -- will trigger it merely by saying, ""Okay."" Right now I have three Android phones in use, and it pisses me off when two of then vibrate and search for everything after the word ""okay."" Sometimes I can't even figure what triggered them!

I keep wondering if I can train it to use ""gerrymander flapdoodle methuselah"" instead of ""okay Google."". I wish you could set your trigger phrase on all phones like you can on Motorola devices! I had a great one set on my Moto X (""hello Gideon,"" referring to the AI in the TV show The Flash).. I know Samsung was using, ""Hey, Galaxy,"" on (at least) some of their Galaxy products. When I got my Galaxy A20 last month, one of the first things I did was disable Bixby. I can only stand so much help.. I disabled it too because all the reviews say Google Assistant is superior. Maybe it's time to rethink that if it's stopped being able to do the one thing I ever ask it for. Hopefully Google knows and a fix will come soon.",575.0,7,103,1

but first of all the screenshot feature change is objectively stupid.

second of all, double tap zoom was one of my most used features in earlier android. u double tap the screen (WITH ONE HAND), then slide (WITH ONE HAND) and u can zoom (FREELY, WITH ONE HAND).

how

do i get that back. 

triple tap is stupid to me. i never wanna triple tap the screen. the current gestures for double tap r useless to me. 

magnifier is awful. u triple tap with one hand and its a suddenly-fixed zoom and i have tons of problems with it. 

i searched a ton for this, but its all old irrelevant posts or a ton of things on how to use the magnifier and i despise magnify or whatever. i *love* double tap & slide zoom and i used it *aaaalllll* the time. like constantly. how do i get that on android ten because its insanely frustrating.

also, if devs read this, u could have put double tap and slide into the settings as an option. ur google. that wouldnt be hard. no one at the offices was like ""hey, that was a good feature i used constantly?!""",1,1.0,4.0,"It's still there in most Google apps. It's implemented on an app by app basis, so a lot of apps don't have it at all.. is there a way to get it on google chrome because thats what i mostly used it on. reading, web browsing, image viewing, etc. imo one of the apps that almost needs it. i dont know how its not a setting u can toggle by default (afaik) on chrome because it really would be easy from a dev and esp. google's standpoint (ur google and i guarantee tons of people over at google r upset that thats not there and mobile chrome is a lot more frustrating now)

shits literally a hallmark of one-handed phone operation

magnify is totally different and for those purposes absolutely dogshit. im leaving some of those there in case someone important from google reads this sub but fr is there a way to get it on chrome

imo chrome is the best browser hands-down too so it matters quite a bit to me. i found an article that mentioned that they turned it off for *mobile* pages so i switched a couple sites over to desktop and double tap zoom works now, altho it would imo be pretty costless to enable or at least give the option to enable it for mobile sites too, altho one site in particular had an awful mobile view so it ended up being pretty nice. that being said if theres a way to enable it with mobile views this thread is still relevant to me but im not as frustrated with it

edit: oh my god it only applies to the tab ur in or what

edit2: okay also if u set a tab to desktop view and then open a page from the same site in a dif tab, its in mobile view so this is dumb af. fr this shit woulda been so easy for devs to problem-solve wtf.

edit3: dear google, im gonna give some settings ideas that i know for a fact should be super easy to implement: 

""enable double tap zoom for mobile sites""

""make this particular site always default to desktop view""

""default all mobile sites to desktop view""

three checkbox settings that r far from difficult to implement unless theres some dumb shit in the code somehow preventing u from doing so. 

u can even have them nested in settings. im gonna keep looking but i saw an article on keeping desktop mode from tab to tab/permanently (also annoying, no middleground because SOME sites i do like mobile view on and am not gonna need zoom but LOTS of sites i dont like mobile view on and/or also like/almost need double tap) and that sites solution is shit/ridiculous.

edit4: yeah im not tryina bog down this phone with xda dev stuff so this is dumb af. also *parts* of this website let me zoom in mobile view but not the important parts.. this is an example note to if a dev or someone from google is readin this (for a setting to always enable one particular user-chosen site to be in desktop view):

if (thissitealwaysdesktop[websitenumber] == true && desktopview.dviewsitevar[websitenumber] == true) desktopview.enabled();

obviously i have no idea how yall program stuff but that should just be an obvious example. dviewsitevar could be an array that holds the boolean value for desktop mode for any given site in a file.

u could have a client-side file storing any given website name (reduced to the first part i.e. reddit.com or etc.gov or whatever)), followed by the ""number""/order it was stored (to be read for websitenumber)/added to settings as always being desktop

and desktopview obv doesnt have to be a class but it illustrates what im talking about pretty well.",616.0,9,216,1

This post will help you to deal with this problem 


1. Download [App Inspector ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.projectoria.appinspector) app from playstore and locate the apps which you want to remove. Tap on it and you will see the package name of that app. Note down the package name somewhere on a paper. You will need it later on.

2. Download Platform tools and ADB Drivers of your phone on pc.
     i) :- [Plat form tools ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hBMnPhiaSXLDwpsJ2xgW3msevj2Dqpr/view?usp=drivesdk)

     ii) [Universal ADB Drivers ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dTgIS1Ys_uB0DmsTq27dvMaIKFaaepn/view?usp=drivesdk)

3. Enable USB Debugging on your phone. 

4. Connect your phone to your pc via a USB cable and locate ADB Driver folder which you downloaded earlier and run Universal ADB Driver app. It will automatically detect your phone. Now install USB Drivers. 

5. Now go to platform tools folder and open command prompt window here. 

6. Now enter the following commands and after each command press Enter. 
   i) adb devices 
   ii) adb shell
   iii) pm uninstall -k --user 0 name of package

Note :- replace ' name of package' with the package name which you have noted at the 1st step. 

7. By now you would have able to remove the system apps. 

8. If you still have some confusion you can watch my YouTube video on it. Hope this information helps you. 
 ['Uninstall System Apps from your Phone| 2020'](https://youtu.be/dGoWjTbDWQ8)",2,0.57,9.0,"psa: disable preinstalled apps that don't have updates installed (you can uninstall the updates!) if you don't like them. There are adb commands to ""uninstall them"" (its really a disable and hide button basically) but you won't ever get *any* more storage by doing that, since they're stored in a completely different place, with the rest of the OS, that **can't be modified** except by OTA.. That's alot of work, ima just ignore the apps. Updates can be uninstalled by going into app settings in phone itself.
But yeah You won't be able to free up storage but you will be able to remove those annoying icons and those apps will not consume any more battery by running in background. Well actually it's just a simple command
But yeah you need to download the stuff before doing this.

Rest is upto you ✌️. I would be afraid that I would delete something that was needed by other apps. I recently switched to the Gallery app from Simple Tools.

Yeah exactly. I wouldn't do this but even if I did I would just remove Facebook and other non removable third party apps that hog up storage. Not the system apps.. Yeah some are necessary apps but others aren't
So you have to carefully select the apps before doing this. That's your call.

Now the buyer is asking for my pin. I don't know if it's safe. What should I do?",13,0.75,30.0,"Don't sell a phone that hasn't been wiped.. You can wipe your device data remotely if you have enabled find my device/mobile previously.. or your account is still signed in on that device... Why would you sell it without resetting it ?. Arrange a meetup and do it yourself? Not a good idea to sell an unresetted phone anyway.. Go to android.com/find, login with your Google account, select the device you sold, then choose Erase This Device.  I can't remember if you're required to put in that Google account again to set it up after wipe.  I'd offer to meet up with the seller in accordance with social distancing requirements in your area to sort it out if so.  In the future, always wipe first.. Dont give out your password. Either remote wipe it or meet up with the guy and do it there. 

Or let him return it if you didn't disclose it was locked beforehand.. I accidentally did this once (I was the seller).

I sold my old working Nexus 5X on eBay. Before I posted it, I dutifully factory reset the device and sent it on its merry way. When the buyer received it, he tried to login to the phone with his Google account, but it was locked to the previous owner (i.e. me!). Long story short, I should have _removed_ my Google account from the device _before_ I reset the phone. Reason being, it would be easy for someone to steal your phone, factory reset it and then it's theirs.

The guy seemed really nice so I took a massive gamble and gave him my username and password. He phoned me and we logged him in live on the phone. The moment his account was loading up, I went into _my_ Google account and immediately changed the password and also deactivated and reactivated two factor authentication. I also centrally logged myself out of every device my Google account was logged into. Lesson learned!

TLDR: Sold a phone but forgot to remove my Google account before hard-resetting it. Arranged a phone call; gave buyer my username, password and 2FA code; logged him in; immediately changed my password and 2FA.. Use adb to clear it. If you don't have an unlocked bootloader, you can just unlock it and wipe the device. No, it doesn't root it.. Ask him to wipe the data and reset the phone from stock recovery using power and volume buttons. No need of a pc.. Tell him to enter wrong pin until the phone wipes. Tell them no or cut contact. Let them just restore it, too much sensitive data on phones.. Just wondering is this a Google account or Samsung account setting? I have not signed up for a Samsung account yet.. Not everyone is tech savvy.. Wow. I just can't believe this service requires an app to be installed and isn't built in by default.

Nor can I believe that I haven't heard of it before.. You can't use adb if you haven't enabled usb debugging and allowed the rsa token for the computer of the new owner beforehand though.. The seller is at fault here, they shouldn't have sold the device without factory resetting it and removing their Google account from it. The right thing to do would be to meet with the buyer and factory reset and remove the account from the device.. https://youtu.be/0DYnyShEX3Y. Isn't that common sense? To erase your data before giving it to anyone?. Then give the god damn code,
Don't leave the other guy hanging, he's spent money already, he deserves to be able to use the phone.. You can use it via web with just your Google account, even if the app is not on your device.  Also it's a good place to ring a device if you can't find it and it's on vibrate or silent.. You can't if screen is broken. True, but the buyer is also an idiot for not checking before handing over the cash for it.. The seller can perform a reset themselves.. What does common sense have anything to do with tech savvyness?

I wouldn't know how to reset a phone with a broken screen.. It will still ask for the previous account at set up, that's why the seller needs to actually log in and remove their account from the settings.. I think most android users know that we can reset a phone from recovery without touch screen using volume rockers and power buttons. Its like using windows without knowing about recovery or basic BIOS functions. And a quick Google search will give you info. Its not an excuse in this information era. Nor you have to write any code to do that basic thing. But i can see most of people here don't know about recovery menu either, so you are somewhat correct.. Yeah sure, but you wouldn't sell it. That's common sense.. Common sense is not selling it and bitching about having to give the code. 
You either sell it after you reset it or give the code so he can use the phone. He paid for the phone.. If you remove the account on the Google website but not the device,  does it prompt you for login data after a factory reset?

I can't remember clearly but I think I still had to get the original owner of my phone to provide their login details to bypass the Google login screen even though they removed the device remotely..

606,Wi-Fi not working correctly on my Samsung Galaxy A50,h0ub9i,2020-06-11 07:16:18," In the last month, I had connection issues with my Samsung Galaxy A50, which I bought very recently.

My router as no problems and connection works correctly on every other device, except for mine. After I use my smartphone for some time, an exclamation point appears near the Wi-Fi icon, forcing me to switch to mobile data.

I don't remember doing anything wrong or strange in my settings.

I already tried to reset my network settings and, of course, restarted my phone many times.

I don't know if it's the same thing, but I tried to use a hotspot connection with my brother's phone and it worked just fine.

I use Bluetooth less than an hour per day and the problem occurs both when it's activated and when it's not.

Do you have any idea what I should do? Did anyone else experience this? If so, how did you fix that? Is there any information you need in order to help me?

I have a Galaxy s9. I like that it's 5.8 inches but if it were smaller it'd be even better. 

I looked at the s10e but it seems to have a puny battery like my s9. 

I love my s9 except for the 4gb ram and the battery. Anyone can recommend me a phone of similar or smaller size? No need to use the best processor if the cameras are good. Plus middling processors last longer on battery usually, I know my xiaomi a1 did. 

Thanks!",2,1.0,9.0,"Maybe the Pixel 3a or the Xperia 5? Both are taller and wider than the S9 but they're some of the narrowest new Android phones. I'm not recommending the Pixel 4 because of its horrible battery life. The 4a should have been launched but no one knows when it'll show up. Alternatively you could consider the iPhone 11 Pro if you don't mind moving over to iOS.. Pixel 3a probably. The S20 despite the 6.2inch screen is actually very very close in size to the S9 (I moved from S9 to S20), but you did want something smaller.. The pixel 3a is a downgrade from the S9 in every way other than still photo quality. And it's bigger anyways.. Thanks! I live jn Brazil so it's hard to find a Pixel but it's nice to know the s20 is almost the same size. How do you feel about the battery?. The display is a downgrade as far as the quality is concerned but I'm assuming they'll make the trade-off for better battery life which is something they mention they want. The software experience is subjective, some people prefer Google's UI, others prefer One UI. The faster storage is the only downgrade that's likely to be noticeable imo.

Unfortunately OEM's just don't seem interested in making smaller phones anymore. I suppose there's the iPhone SE 2020 but I'm not sure if it's battery life is going to match the S9's.. It's fine. I got an Exynos so it's not as good as the Snapdragon, but it does last me through the day. GSAM tells me I average around 4.5hrs SOT at 15hrs standby, so it pretty much can last morning til night on a single charge.. The s20 is almost the same size as the S9. The iPhone X/XS/11 Pro are little shorter than S9, little wider, and the 11 Pro is definitely a better phone (maybe even the Xs) - I'm ignoring the iOS vs android debate here though.

Edit: fixing forgetting the ""Pro"" in iPhone 11 Pro. The S20 is a good size but the battery life could be good or mediocre depending on your region. The 11 Pro is a similar size but the 11 is quite a bit bigger.. Yes I meant 11 Pro, the 11 is a behemoth haha.

Yeah, the S20 only makes sense in Snapdragon regions..",389.0,6,88,1

- Try a rootless firewall app. It's the same with the expected result of data off, where pipes exist but apps are forbidden from using it.

(Ip adress, mac adress etc) Does anyone know?",1,1.0,6.0,"MAC Address is associated with the chip or efs/nvram/nvdata which isn't reset. Recent phones may send a random one.

IP Address, well there are 2 kinds,

- External IP Address (this is ""the"" IP Address) is of the provider, not the phone. Stuff exits through it and enters the External IP of a website. It is unlikely that a provider would reserve a limited resource while offline so it is likely to change, unless you've subscribed to reserving it. A VPN or Proxy connects a provider to another provider.

- The internal IP Address exists to share (what leads to the) External IP Address with multiple devices. It depends on how your WiFi or provider's router (CGNAT) is set up. You may set up your phone to ask for a static internal IP from your router.. Factory Reset doesn't change your Mac Address. You can try spoofing your Mac address but for that you would need to root your phone.

If you are just trying to change your ip without anonymity on an un-rooted device you can try faking a Mac address on your router. But if you don't mind slow speeds you could try a VPN.

Also you should read this [factory Reset does what to your phone ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.securegroup.com/want-to-erase-everything-on-a-phone-you-need-something-better-than-factory-reset%3fhs_amp=true). Thanks for that. Really apreciated. But my real question is what does a factory reset do?. Reset system settings (volume, brightness,...) , uninstall all apps, remove app settings, remove all pictures and videos,;

basically the phone's like new unless you updated the Android then the updates remain.. Let me explain myself. Basically, the app won't let you have more than 1 account per device. But if you reset you device, you can create a new one, and that's what i really need. So i guess that resetting a phone change something special🤔 i might be dumb tho. Maybe the Android Device ID?

Reinstalling may help you. Considering you make no mention of what device you have (it matters) what android version it has (it matters) Its rather difficult to try and troubleshoot without such important device information.

The good news here is everything is working fine on Alcatel (pie) and Samsung and Nokia (android10). First check if your WhatsApp ver allows pop-ups. Goto settings > notifications [pop-up not allowed ](https://ibb.co/Hzkqmtj)

If it does make sure notifications is turned on there and under app info as well. Easiest way would be launch WhatsApp, tap on RECENT APPLICATIONS Icon on your navigation bar, long press the WhatsApp icon displayed on top of the card and select APP INFO, and then make sure the notifications are not disabled 
[1](https://ibb.co/1G59SdK)
[2](https://ibb.co/HpZLHh3) 
[3](https://ibb.co/mv8XY94) 

Also go into Settings > Notifications > Do Not Disturb and make sure it's not turned on. If it so then make sure WhatsApp is not listed.. Hahaha yeah always backup. Just make certain the background data option is enabled.

Under data usage click on mobile data usage, and then on whatsapp. It is enabled and it should bcs 
I will not get any notifications even in the notification bar if i disable it i guess. Well i have Samsung s9+ and android 9 
And i don't know why i didn't i hadn't an update to android 10 yet 😅. I already did all these solutions and they didn't work
For the pop up notification 
When i allow it it shows the whole conversation window in the middle of the screen 
It doesn't show me just the notification. Bcs it pisses me off 
I always have to be on mute and always check the notification bar if there is new messages
I gotta fix this problem. It says 
Allow this app to use mobile data while running in the background 
I don't see any problem with that. I got a Samsung A40 and wife has a Samsung A10 (in UK)
The A40 had the android 10 update in march, and the A10 had it in may.. Then try force stop, clear the cache and data. It will not delete the Messaging history, just the app data. You will need to re-initialize the app. If that fails clear the data again and reinstall the app.. Well then only one thing left mate.. Sorry. So it depends on the country as well ?. That's what i'm trying to do right now i'll back up my messages first 
Them try these scary options 😂. Only thing left is to reinstall the app ig i will see if that will work. No, my and my wife's WhatsApp are working great, did on pie too. Btw you don't have any background data restrictions set at app level or device level  do you?. I'm talking about the update to android 10 
And i don't why it's not working well for me 
I tried al the solutions in google and youtube 
None of them worked. Like the one we do with mobile data ? 
No i don't do it with apps 
And i even turned off the power mode for the battery 
And i unclicked all the apps ... including gmail even if it shows these annoying notifications of ads ... etc. There's still S10s around that havent had android 10 yet.

Yes android updates can depend on your location but I think In your case it's to do with your carrier.

Have you tried downloading the android 10 update from sammobile for your country manually and attempted to update that way?

There's another post here about Samsung's not getting android 10

https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/h0pkg0/im_stuck_on_android_9/. No i didn't tried 
Can you tell me how 
I've seen people doing it with ROOT 
I don't know how to do it the easy way. https://youtu.be/bnPkwICq_Bw. That's the exact video i saw hahaaha 
I'm afraid to risk it like that. Unfortunately there's no other way apart from contacting your carrier to find out why you haven't got it.

Seems to be an issue with some Samsung's using certain carrier in continental USA/ south America and Canada, although I've read of instances of S10s not getting android 10 in Europe.

Or you could try the Vpn method.

https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-6/how-to/ota-updates-quicker-savage-vpn-method-t3802012. If i kept a vpn 
I would receive an update ?. Keeping a VPN doesn't affect the update after you get it, you can remove it once you downloaded the update or you can keep it, up to you.

I used a free VPN from Google play to get android 10 on my Nokia 4.2 back in march because the UK was slow to get android 10 on certain Nokia's using a certain carrier, I got the update after installing the Vpn and using Finland as the home network.

*My Samsung A40 is provided to me by my employer and all our Samsung's at work all updated at once via the work server on the same evening*. So after i use a vpn ill get the update instantly ?
I always use a vpn to usa

646,1st Smartphone for my 70 yr old Mom!,h0d3t7,2020-06-10 15:24:48,"My mom has been scared to get a smart phone for many years. She's had her old one for over a decade, and it's extremely outdated now! (It has a slide out keyboard lol) She's turning 70 and I need to get her an easy one to figure out. I'll be there to help, but she has memory issues and brain fog, so I believe an easy to use phone will be the most important part. I've looked up a few but I am so lost. Reviews I've read don't exactly have her in mind...

Originally, I saw good things about the One Plus 7t, but it seems as though it's going to be hard to find a case and she drops her phone a lot. She liked the pretty One Plus 8, but it had mixed reviews and I'd hate to get something that doesn't work well because it's ""pretty"" =) We don't have 5G around us either. She likes our Galaxy S8 actives but they aren't available any longer. 

Other phones available for our carrier and small budget are: Revvlry+, Galaxy A20, Moto G7 Power, LG Stylo 5 or K51. 

Any ideas on which is durable and/or intuitive for a 70 yr old newbie?

Thank you so much for your time and opinions. If this is the wrong place to ask for advice/help I sincerely apologize.",23,0.88,33.0,"I've have three G7 Powers (got them for free if you were wondering). It is a very nice phone at a very good price though generally I would avoid Motorola except your use case. Avoid LG like the plague. The Revvlry+ is complete garbage. I'd say the OnePlus is overkill. And will end with that I am partial to Samsung myself but have no first hand experience with the A-Series, have only owned the S-Series. 

I do believe (I have to double check) that the G7 Power works with Team Viewer Quick Support so you could remote control/troubleshoot with her on the phone if need be. 

I wouldn't go the Apple route (I've had one and my dad has one) and the Pixel A-Line is a good option as well.. iPhone se or pixel 3a/4a. Stick with stock Android or iOS, don't get any bloated carrier skins from samsung or lg or something. And get a hefty case if she drops the thing all the time.

If you go with the pixel, put nova launcher on it and give her a custom home screen layout (and lock it so she can't accidently delete something). Make large icons, and label them like ""chrome (internet)"" ""google messages (texting)"" ""Gmail (email)"" ""duo (video calling)"" etc so she knows what each app does. Put a calling/texting shortcut to you for tech support and maybe a few other favorite contacts on the home screen and well. Have her pick a wallpaper she likes and teach her to know when it's time to charge the device and how to change the volume (especially when on the phone) and she should be all set.. Either the Moto G7 Power or the newer G Power. Both have a big battery and are pretty friendly to older people. I'd set the font to a larger size and use Nova Launcher to make the menu similar to Samsung's Easy Mode on their Galaxy phones.. Chose a iPhone or pixel device. No bloatware, and stock Android/iOS. Install BaldPhone (on GitHub). get her an s8 active if she likes that.

it doesn't matter if they aren't in stores anymore!
you can get it somewhere else. iPhone SE. Most cities have a local Apple store for tech support and trouble shooting. They have reliable updates for 5+ years. A more secure App Store than google. And for the most part are very user friendly.

Unless you want to be her constant personal IT guy. If that’s the case I’d probably go with like a Samsung s10e for cheap.. Why do you think it's going to be hard to find a case for a op7t?. What she want to do with this new phone?. Pixel 2xl. I still use mine and it works great, is durable (not glass), and is available for very cheap.. Try getting a galaxy a51, they are for 380$ on amazon. Easy interface, so should be good for your mother. Try looking for the galaxy xcover 4s (notice the s, don't get the one without it). Rugged, good specs, not that expensive. If you can pay a bit more, xcover pro. Way better specs, bigger screen (!) for around 500$. Definitely get a phone with expandable memory. Both my parents constantly run out of memory space. Now my mom has to androids; one to watch YouTube and one for WhatsApp. Believe me they run out space coz they don't remember to manage it. My dad won't make a switch from iPhone so his 64gb is constant pain in the butt. I won't recommend an iPhone for many many reasons.. Pixel 3a no doubt, and a Rhinoshield case if she drops once every 3 days or more (else might be expensive)

She'll probably like the perfect camera as a bonus if she takes lots of pics. Isn't there something like a older people launcher? So with that it doesn't matter as much which device you get. If you can get her a used version of her last phone, in good shape, I'd go for that.

My 70-year-old grandmother doesn't understand that touch screens are sensitive to skin contact, not pressure, and her phone often ""doesn't work"", because she's pushing on it with the ends of her fingernails.

It's much easier to use a phone with physical buttons, because they just work the way anyone would expect them to.. Some phones have a feature for kids and old people, I found one in my old Asus, but it exist in other brands too but not all series

This feature will use special launcher / home screen, with big icon and only provide shortcuts to essential apps, other apps are hidden, so they can accidentally activate anything. I only put ones we would get to add a line, or without too much $$$. Her experience is important to me, but I've only had android before... could I show/teach her how to use an iphone without any prior knowledge? Lol a pixel might be easier.

Thank you for your help and all the information you've shared! I will definitely look them up because I'm not familiar. I'm also gonna save to look back upon the good advice =D. I'm going to note your idea with Nova launcher and locking the home screen! I never thought of this and my Mom does this frequently.. Many of the manufacturers like LG and Samsung have a ""simple"" UI option that is basically like a ""dumbified"" phone, making it pretty easy to use and adding a layer between the more-advanced features.  I think those are better options for android phones than a pixel for someone who is not really used to (or gets confused with) smart phones.. This, or you could also go with LG and turn on Easy Home. Does a lot of that^ for you. Here's a link to BaldPhone:
https://baldphone.com. Agree. Even though this is an Android sub and asked for Android, for an older person who struggles with tech go with an iPhone se2 for $399 


I have just gone through this with my mother and my father in law. 

I had android phones for both of them and they just couldn’t with with them, but the iPhones were ultimately easier for them.. Honestly that just makes things more complex if it fails. I’d just stick to teaching her the basics of iOS or Android. The former might be easier in the long run.. You can teach her an iPhone without prior knowledge. One thing I do like about iOS is my grandmother can’t break it.. I mentioned it above; manufacturers like LG and Samsung have ""Simple"" UI options in their software, specifically intended for situations like this.  I think it's a better option than a pixel; google doesn't have anything like this built into their software.. Then no security updates and a shit tier ui that changes too much from stock which makes remote support more difficult.. Well i use teamviewer quicksupport for those kind of instances. And it blows their minds every single time 😂. iPhones are easy to use but the interface is confusing if you start using it. Not sure what you mean. My personal is a G8 and is nearly indistinguishable from the Pixel 4. Couldn't be father from the truth. You're either trolling or really not in a position to give out phone advice if you can't spot those differences.. In terms of UI it's nearly identical. The ""backend"" software is at least as important as the gui, and the gui/design is vastly different anyway.

I installed the ROM and tried to reboot the phone but it won't turn on (boot loop). Is there a way to fix this problem? Is the phone gone forever? Note: I'm only able to run Odin-Download Mode.

Uninterrupted access in Anydesk is allowed with password, but this warning comes everytime and my GF has to click on start now every damn time which defeats the purpose of uninterrupted access.

Because of this if the screen timesout(and locks) , she has to click on start now again to give me access.

someone said he had problems-(Not with A71 but with a different phone, but same screen protector brand I was looking for) - with the fingerprint feature, The problem is Not in the phone but when he put the screen protector the fingerprint sensor seems less effective,because you know the Samsung A71 fingerprint sensor is under the screen.

So does this happen with all screen protectors?, and is there a screen protector that is made to fit the fingerprint sensor and doesn't affect it?


Thanks!

Also I appreciate any suggestions for good screen protectors for Samsung A71 and also good cases that protects the phone from drops.",2,0.63,12.0,"I was wondering the exact same thing, but I'll tell you one thing:

The in display fingerprint sensors are of different types.

I remember a video made by MKBHD where he demonstrated that some in display sensors did not work with wet fingers and screen protectors.

To get a better answer by someone else, I think you could mention the type of sensor on the A71.. I have 1+ 7t that have fingerprint scanner under display like a71. I bought original screen protector from OnePlus and I don't have problems with fingerprint scanner reading.. I have an A50 with a regular tempered glass protector and there is sometimes a bit of an issue getting it to register. It is not enough to recommend against the phone and is easily fixed by using your pin or just wiping off the screen a bit.

I dont know if the A50 and A71 have the same type of scanner. A50 is optical.. you need to keep in mind that there are 2 different types of in display/under display finger print readers

  
optical, that actually needs the phone to light up the portion of screen, and ultrasonic which should not have a problem with 2-4 mm thickness added, but keep in mind that you will need to register the finger with the screen protector since thickness will modify the mapping due to distance added. Some screen protectors will alter how it reads your fingerprint and some will make it almost unusable. If it's a one off review, odds are that it probably the original fingerprint that the phone is looking for, not the altered one through the screen protector.. Considering the normal dry hands, will it work normally?. Sounds good,what brand would you recommend as a screen protector and also a protective case? Thanks. Someone else said the opposite,He said the ultrasonic is the one that is havong problems with the protection. I don't know, take that you think is good, watch reviews. I think if there is something like original protector or case from Samsung that is specially designed for your phone, then take this.. if he/she was trying to use a fingerprint mapped before the protector yes, mapping will br diferent entirely because of distance added, thats what im saying you will need to add fingerprint again

  
do the testing yourself, add a screen protector to one of your friends phones (the one with the model you talking about) put the screen protector on the screen without peeling off the protective layer so it doesnt glue to it, and add a fingerprint, if it works you have nohing to worry about  
it will be a 3-5 bucks experiment. I don't know someone with A71, but thanks anyway. https://youtu.be/472XABMutsI

664,How to free up space on my phone?,h04z77,2020-06-10 06:05:32,"I have a P10 Lite, and despite of having fewer and fewer apps on it, the 35gb internal storage is simply full. It has been getting fuller and fuller and now it asks me ever two hours to free up space. I checked; all the large files, photos are on the SD card (every single thing it wants me to delete to free some space up- apart from the apps- are on the SD card so removing them would do precisely nothing to make more space.)

I have no idea what the extra stuff might be that is taking up space: I checked the phone, and it is has large directories which are shown as empty. I suspect there might be a lot of leftover stuff which is not used, but I have no idea how to remove it apart from reseting the phone (which I would like to avoid).

Can anyone suggest me an app/method that can take care of this thing?
Thank you",3,1.0,10.0,"Try the DiskUsage app. 

The storage may fill up by itself. This includes:

- App caches, anything that may be stored by apps that might improve efficiency, e.g. apps may keep images from the Internet on the phone so that the next time the same image is seen it'll likely load faster and save data. (settings → apps → apps → (app) → storage → clear cache)

- Dalvik/ART Cache, while the battery is full, the most comnonly used parts of apps are made more efficient, and the more efficient copy is stored along with the original.

The visible internal storage is the folder /data/media/0/. Both of these are in another folder.. Connect it to a PC and sync off as much of what you want to save as you can, and then do a factory reset.  It sounds like you have an app misbehaving and logging something or something that is saving content and when you are removing it, it is only removing it from view and not deleting it.   Considering the weirdness I suggest doing a Hard Factory Reset and building your phone.

The only other option is to learn Android Studio/ADB and the Android File System and figure out what is taking up so much space.  If the devices wasn't running out of space you could get an app to tell you that.  It sounds like it is time to rebuild the OS anyway.. SD Maid, it's the best there is IMO.

And I should add, despite the name it is actually great at handling the phones internal storage.. Thank you for the response. The reason I am reluctant to do that is that this is my only way now to log into my Barclay's bank account, since I am not living in the UK presently, and I am not sure if I can set up the program again from abroad (and probably would not get support, either...) Anyhow, I will check.. Thank you. Will try ASAP.. OK, just gave it a shot. It is weird. 23gb of 24gb internal storage is full, but when I click on it to see the details, it shows 11gb for android and apps, and the rest is literally just a couple of more items of less than 1mbyte. In other words 12gb of data is just not shown.
Where is this magical data?? (Same issue when I take a look at the phone's files through the computer's explorer. Half of the storage is taken up but not shown.). If you have access to a PC you can install software on, and Barclay's has an online live support channel that can help like chat, CyberGhostVPN has a free tier VPN that is largely a slow and restricted version you can use to test their service out for free and you could VPN into the UK and fib about being abroad.  Just a thought.. Unless you pay for SD Maid, I don't think it clears the cache partition.

I use Media Monkey to WiFi sync with my PC; I'm not sure what's currently the actual player...MM or Google Play but of the various music players I've tried those 2 are the overall best (GP wins for ""just play the damn music"" and MM wins for overall versatility).

Google's replacement for GP, ""Youtube Music"" refuse's to touch my 200gb+ library of music on the sd card so that got trashed about 5min after Google forced it's install. I don't see the point in wasting my limited data on streaming music when giant SD cards are so cheap.... As someone who has done this, MANY times, a few thoughts.

First, you are currently an apple person, so you are not used to the android controls. Find a friend, or better yet a few friends, who have been android users for a while, at least a couple of years. See if one of them has a phone they upgraded from they do not want, Free is always the best, especially when you are just trying this, first attempt.  Make sure they do not mind if you ask them questions.

Wipe the data on that phone, it is not hard at all to do, just google factory data reset (model of phone), always do a full reset on a phone you just acquired, it is the safest way to go.

while you are googling, read how to put an SD card in, go buy the biggest one that phone will support and you can justify spending the money for.  I just bought a couple of 128 Gig cards for like 26.00, I think it was from Costco, not sure.

Get your accounts set up, ask questions if you need to. I usually install Pandora, Spotify, Youtube, Simple audio book player, ( I listen to audio books a lot) and whatever music player is highly rated in the play store right now. There are a lot of players, if one annoys you uninstall it and try a different one.

Drag a bunch of music onto it and have fun!

The G5 has no network issues. The G7 has chronic messaging issues. The only app we're using for messaging is the default Messages app from Google. MMS messages often take 5-15 minutes to send, or won't send at all until we turn off wifi. SMS messages sometimes won't send either. When I say they won't send, they say ""sending"" for a long time, then say it failed. Sometime the only way to send multiple SMS messages in a row is to restart the phone between each message. It is frustratingly erratic, so we haven't been able to isolate conditions that consistently replicate the problem, but it happens often.

Our carrier confirms that the settings are correct. The SIM card is pretty old and has some slight signs of wear, but they charge to replace it (ugh), so we haven't tried that yet. (If taking the phone off wifi sometimes fixes the problem, does that mean it's not the SIM card?) Moto is still updating Android for the G7, and the phone itself is fully updated.

682,"Are the cameras in low-end 2020 Androids ""Good Enough""?",gzvouo,2020-06-09 20:41:44," One of the biggest challenges with low-end devices has historically been the much-inferior camera. It's possible to get by with a slower CPU, less memory, and less/slower storage, but a poor camera is for many a tough pill to swallow, especially parents.

In 2020, with new ""low-end"" devices, is the camera ""good enough"" now to suffice for even critical shots, say for new parents wanting to capture images of their family?

I ask about relatively new or upcoming new low-end devices, such as:

* Moto E7
* Nokia 3.1+
* Samsung Galaxy A10e

Devices like these are ""relatively"" cheap ($200 or less, many available for a fraction of that when switching service.)

Has the low-end camera evolved enough that it isn't really a big consideration anymore?

And, further, how does Google Camera (and/or ports) change things?",1,1.0,5.0,"Out of the devices you listed, forget the Samsung, it *only* has a single 13mp camera.

Forget the Nokia, it's not a *new* device, it was released in 2018.

The Moto has a dual camera set up and on paper has the better camera specs, but there are some other budget devices that have dual camera set ups, and using the new camera go app from Google gives some very good results.

Whilst I'm not a new parent, I am a new grandfather and I'm using an Alcatel 3 (2019) (£90 in UK) with a dual camera set up (13mp / 2mb + 8mp selfie) and using the Google app makes all the difference to the image quality.

Using the stock Alcatel camera app leaves poor results with light, saturation and colour depth.. Honestly it's up to you on what you consider as acceptable. Maybe 5 years ago the camera on lower end devices now would be considered flagship level. The question is, where would you be coming from in terms of phone camera. Would the cameras on these phones be worse or better than what you previously considered acceptable?  


Also, think of this: I have an S20, and while I still take better pics than my mom's A51, the pictures from the A51 are very acceptable quality to me, and I've only used Notes and S phones for most of my smartphone life.

Google Camera changes the processing to something better. Google Camera Go is actually available for download as an apk, so even if the phone didn't come with it, you can take advantage of it.. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and your experience with your Alcatel! Would you be willing to share an image taken by both the Alcatel default Camera and th Google Camera (or Google Camera Go) on your device for comparison purposes?. It would be easier for you to download the Google camera go apk to your device and test, as posting camera images to Google drive or imagur to link here make them compressed and loose quality which doesn't show you the benefits of the Google camera app.

Just another heads up, these Alcatel (TCL) devices don't receive Android or regular security updates, the 2019 pie model I have has been replaced (in UK) with a 3X 2020 variant running Android 10.
The 2019 model I have is now on sale for £89 (down from £149) and will soon be discontinued.


The new flagship is the TCL 10 (£200) and it appears the Alcatel branding is now slowly being dropped from use.

Downloading the camera go apk is a much better solution to purchasing a new device and being disappointed with the camera after a few hours use.. Thanks for the insight, I appreciate the heads up. I have a Pixel 3 right now, but the battery life is starting to suffer, and I'm not interested in paying a fortune for a premium device just for a decent camera.

Basically you just need to un-disable those apps.  I'll bet whatever app you used to disable them warned you, too.  Make sure you know what apps do before going and disabling or uninstalling them.

You can either do this through adb, or as you mentioned, hook up a usb keyboard and use that to get in.. You're right. I sure did disable the Samsung Keyboard. and you're also right about knowing which apps I disable before I disable them which I actually thought about after I got locked out. I'm going to find out how to do the ADB process, but sn't it a little tricky?. All you need is the package name, which I'm gonna assume is probably the same on every Samsung phone on the same or similar android version.  You can give XDA a try, I'll bet it's either documented, or you can ask in a new post.. The ""package name"" as in what? What specifically am I asking for? I'm confused. Keep in mind, I'm learning as I go and I appreciate all the advice you've given thus far.

Also I was able to access the bootloader or whatever and I saw an option that said something about ADB, will this be something be using as well? I've always been terrified of all this ADB and rooting stuff. I have the ability to overthink my way out of accomplishing the simplest things. lol. Every app has a visible name (Facebook) and a package name (com.android.facebook.katana).  The package name is used as an identifier internally, and is especially handy if apps have the same visible name.  The visible name is only shown to the user, but everywhere else the package name is what matters, not the visible name.

Past that, I do not have a lot of experience with ADB, but based on my experience with command line programs, just make sure you type everything exactly as it's spelled out to you, and you're good.. Thank you for explaining what the package name meant. I've always wondered who's Katana and what does she have to do with Facebook. Hahahaha!

But if you found one, the application manifest (where it also registers all the permissions it needs, etc.) should include a section called <intent-filters> that includes a list of MIME types it supports. For example, the application manifest for Amazon Kindle includes intents for `application/pdf`, etc. so you can open PDF files with Kindle even though they're not Kindle files.",321.0,12,72,1
696,Can an android phone crash because of too many push notifications ?,gzp49z,2020-06-09 15:18:22,"Hi everyone!   


1. I was wondering if getting 10 000 push notifications at the same time would cause your android  phone to crash / turn off  ?  -> for example, you get 10 000 likes on instagram.           


2.Do you know if I can send 10 000 notifications to my customers on my app, or is there a restriction (for example : 1 push notif per minute or something)    


Thanks a lot!",6,0.8,3.0,"There is a limit. One notification (with sound) per second

To send notifications you need a analytics tool like firebase.google.com. I suppose that most apps are regulated in a way to stop this from happening, like they are limited to only output 10 notifications per second. Also, I suppose that it would just slow down your phone if you receive a lot of notifications at the same time because the phone runs out of ram. I think it depends on how the Rom regulates input that goes over the devices performance, it could either heavily slow down the device until it can catch up and execute all the commands (all the notifications), since that would also heat the phone it could probably cause it to crash.

I'd say it depends on the phone model and os regulations. Appregulation also should play a role since some apps probably only output a limited number of notifications in a specified time no matter how man message the app should output.

Edit: there is also cases where a specific text in a notification can cause a crash, I think apple had this problem recently.

Honestly, I hope you aren't asking this with some malicious intent.

Edit2: I'm not an expert so take this with a grain of salt.. Definitely slows the fuck out of a phone to get a bunch at once, I know from going to camps and turning my phone back on after like 2 weeks of it being off.  I always have to wait for it to finish vibrating before I can use it, cause not only does it slow down, but even if it didn't the popups would just be insanely annoying.",278.0,12,89,1

699,What are the strengths and weaknesses of Android and what features does Android have that Apple doesn't? (vise versa),gzoorx,2020-06-09 14:55:45,Considering trying Android,42,0.91,68.0,"Customization, first to receive new features (even if they're not fully flushed out, you don't have to use them), customization, more choice, not as much lockdown as iPhones, you can change anything you want to whatever you want (ie: different default browser or even appbar style), USB C most laptops also use USB C and their chargers can be used to charge your phone, The almighty universal back button, better multitasking, when plugged into a computer Android interfaces with the computer as a normal camera that you can add or remove photos from unlike iPhones which need iTunes in order to interface with your computer, 3.5 mm headphone jack (on some phones), sideloading apps, True File system, more login options including fingerprint scanner and face unlock, better notification handling by far, better screens with many moving to higher refresh rate screens, really works amazing with Google apps, Google Assistant imo far superior to Siri, widgets, you can completely change your phones UI with launcher, and a lot more that depend on what Android phone you want to get

Probably a good amount I forgot, so I there are any others that anybody else thinks of, feel free to add

Edit: forgot about native & free picture in picture mode. For the uninitiated it's when you can pop out a YouTube or Netflix into a mini version that you drag around or put in the corner and can keep watching while using other apps. This is a big one, can't believe I forgot about this one

Edit 2, Credit to u/catdude142: Android's are usually a better value and competition between OEMs drives down prices making them generally cheaper.

 Also expandable SD card storage is another big plus about Android. Get more local storage by just inserting an SD card that way if you ever run it off space, you don't have to buy a new phone with more storage, instead just expand the storage of your old one

Edit 3: OLED screens with better OLED support. Android's Always On Display functionality is something yet to see on iOS devices. If the feature is turned on it will show the time, date and notification icons when the device is turned off. It is able to turn of the rest of the unused screen pixels other than the ones it is using to display therefore using very minimal battery

Edit 4, Credit to u/ShuvamTheBeast: Android has some really cool apps that you can't get anywhere else like Tasker, an app that lets you schedule take and do IFTT (if this then that) stuff. The app runs locally on your phone. It can do a lot of things and integrate with a lot of other devices and is one of the most powerful apps on Android.

Edit 5: Wireless Charging has seems to be much better on Android phones, they've had it for longer and had more time to innovate on it and perfect it. Samsung's wireless chargers and wireless charging systems seem to be ones currently at the top of the game, with blazing fast wireless charging speeds

Edit 6: Google Pay seems to work better. And if you have a Samsung phone, you have access to Samsung pay which uses a cool trick and therefore can be accepted anywhere you can swipe your card. Google has also allows apps to use the NFC system with the users permission, therefore, Android has gone a lot farther with NFC even allowing to share files just by tapping two phones through NFC. Two things that infuriated me when I tried switching to iPhone:
-no back button
-no split screen.. Unlimited operative system. Android wins in every level.. Copy and paste across apps is a simple thing Android does but can't in IOS. Don't buy a shitty Chinese Android if you have no intentions of removing the bloatware or ads.

Android -

1. Customization - launchers, rooting, apps can be installed from anywhere (hence mods and APK's installations)
2. More apps, but cluttered play store filled with ads and in app purchases
3. Default browser and apps can be changed ( like wtf apple?)
4. Community support forums and help because more people use it.
5. How it works with other phones and especially computers. iPhones are a pain in the ass when trying to copy stuff or connect with a computer.

Many developers increase prices of apps on iOS , because they think you are probably rich

Even though apple's list is longer, Android is usually better for me.

Apple -

1. Polished software with updates for many more years.
2. Top quality hardware
3. Security and privacy (cuz not made by google)
4. Customer care
5. Excellent looking apps (cause app store is restrictive, and devs focus more on iOS)
6. The apple/ iMessage ecosystem
7. Usually better looking photos and videos
8. Rich Guy feeling. One thing that Apple has over Android is accessories, and 3rd party support, specifically in the medical community.

With Apple, they're only developing for a smaller set of devices, with well known hardware, software, and a small set of SDK versions.

With Android, there are always manufacturer specific things.

So, the vendors that make hardware interactive accessories, do it for Apple first. 

You want a EKG in your pocket? A bluetooth enabled CGM that talks to your insulin pump? 

Those exist on Apple first. Ports to Android come much later, and are buggy, and often limited in what devices/brands they'll support (Looking at you Dexcom!) 

The cases are easier to locate. You want a waterproof shock proof, etc case? Apple's got em on launch day. You want one for your random LG device? Good fricken luck. They may exist, eventually, if there's a market. Many Samsung devices will have them, but that's about it.

HOWEVER

if you're not needing to be in the medical device field, and you're not needing something special, Android can give you better performance for your money.. You can literally install Linux to your Android, and pair it with a USB keyboard and mouse and have a fully portable PC.. Strengths of Android: The Play Store. I switched from Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ to iPhone 11 pro max first, then down to iPhone 11 (I work in IT and try to use different devices for testing). Android users take the Play Store for granted. Many apps that are ""free"" on android are either not on the Apple App store, or cost $0.99. 

&#x200B;

You take the Google Apps for granted, also. The Google keyboard is different on an iPhone :(, and it's butchered. 

&#x200B;

You also take the Google Assistant for granted. I miss the google Assistant. It's just not the same on iPhone. You can't summon it with ""ok google"". You gotta either push the app icon to use it, or say ""Hey siri, ok google"" every time. If you do say ""hey siri, Ok google"", it doesn't listen for as long, cuts off after like 1 second, and then searches the cut off prompt, returning results that you didn't want to search for. It also doesn't continue conversation. 

&#x200B;

There are no half-screen ANYTHINGS on iPhone. So if you wanted to watch youtube music while GPS'ing somewhere, forget it. Either you full screen the maps / google maps app, or you full screen YouTube and listen to your GPS.. On android you actually get decent specs. Even the 700 dollar OnePlus 8 has more ram clocked at a faster speed. Like come on apple 1500 bucks and you give out a measly 4 gigs my dell from like 11 years ago has that much. Can you change your icons on an iPhone? If not...android.. Innovation is a big thing due to more liberty given to devs on android.

For ages android had things before iPhone:
Keyboard Haptic feedback, voice assistant customisation, swipe keyboard input,
There's got to be a lost somewhere. 

There's also profiles as well, which gives you 2 virtual phones, in a way.


Inter operation with Apple is a PITA because they try to tie you into their ecosystem. The wierd connector, the broken Bluetooth, the share system, the lack of files system. It's just anti social.

Contrast that to android. You can run a website off android if you want. You can put Linux in many phones.

That said, android is a lot more like apple these days with Google services and more control. 
Its variable how much but There can be a lot of privacy intrusions, which put you at a much higher risk of hacking IMHO. Not sure if it has been said, but mutliuser! iOS has limited multi user features for the educational versions/setups of the iPad.

I've been enjoying multuser on my galaxy tab.. Up until a couple of years ago you couldn't even use a different (better) keyboard on an iPhone.  And iTunes is the worst.. I was thinking of getting my brother to switch to an iphone, he's been an android user from the start. Not a poweruser by any standard. So i figured basic use is what ios does best.
He's into these relatively unknown DJs and listens to a lot of mixes, i brought up the idea and the first question he asked me. ""Can you directly download a song on the iPhone?"".  I had no response, asked a few of my iphone die hards they had long weird workarounds. and in this day and age having workarounds for something so basic just does not make sense. Android all the way!. A jailbroken iPhone is much more customizable than an Android phone, even with the Xposed framework installed. With tweaks made by different devs uploaded to different repositories, you can add specific functionalities to iOS and make it better than Android. An example tweak is Quanta, developed for iOS 13 by HASHBANG Productions, which improves the battery level readout on Apple's Smart Battery Case. Apple's hardware also dominates some Android phones, examples are the upcoming iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max which will be released with a LiDAR sensor specifically implemented for Augmented Reality. Also, the iPhone SE 2nd gen now comes with an 18W USB Type-C charger, which charges the SE to 50% in about 30 minutes. iOS also continues to dominate over every mobile operating system in the world. And in my opinion, Apple dominates over every mobile manufacturing company in the world.. I've never bought an iPhone, found one one time in a bar one time, it was unlocked and charging, played with it for about an hour. Can't see the appeal myself, can't change anything. Overlays in android not in IOS

Multiple app stores or sources for apps

Most has being said above 

But basically a non rooted android or non jailbreaked iPhone is pretty much the same just another software but in both cases you are restricted in your movements. Root is where the magic happens. I don't even know how to use an android without root, think I would freak out. After reading all of the entries here, I saw one missing one (well, that expanded to two).

The cost of the phone.  It's not difficult to get a decent Android phone for $100 or less (yes, the purists will want other models).  I'm using a Samsung J3 Orbit now and I think I paid $50 for it.  It works quite well for what I need (email, web, financial apps, etc).

Also you can add cheap memory on an Android phone with an SD RAM card.  With Apple, you have to buy a new phone because memory isn't expandable.. For me, at least with YouTube picture in picture sucks. It's glitchy, doesn't always appear, the animation is stuttery, etc.. What about awesomeness of apps like Tasker. Also a little advantage android apps have smaller size than ios size so it will save bandwidth while downloading 😅😅. No back button?. This right here. 
I used to have iPhones. Got a Samsung Galaxy tablet as a gift. Would go back and forth with my phone and tablet and the phone did not have that beautiful back button. So I switched. Have had Androids ever since.. It does have the back gesture though, which works way better than the one on android.. That's seems like a crucial missing functionality. If this is true, my iPhone would be 5 inches into the wall within 15 seconds of use. Really annoying you can't copy and paste images however. I'm on a OnePlus and can't copy images from Google and paste them into an Instagram story. I disagree with point 3 and 7(partially) but other than that it is on point.

Images are subjective but video are slightly better on iOS.. Your first point is the most important for anyone considering switching to Android. People will buy a £200 Android phone and complain that Android sucks and is not as good as a £1000 iPhone. If you truly want a good Android experience you need to buy decent Android hardware.. False about phptograph quality. Android is so much better when it comes to photographs. Just take Samsung for an example. Their phones take amazing photographs.. jailbreak and root are not even close the same. Technically, root is not the same as jailbreak, so rooting cannot ever be superior over jailbreaking. They are like each other's doppelganger in another world. Also, as I have mentioned in the most recent comment, iOS is MORE customizable and can be given more functionalities when jailbroken; compared to a rooted Android phone with Xposed.. What root tweaks do you use?. Oh yes, great points I'll add them to the list. Works great for me! Might be a OEM thing, but if I leave the app with the video running it automatically goes into picture in picture mode mode if I turned it on for that app. The animation is fine for me. Might just be a OEM thing or might just be that an actual flagship Android phone where it can handle it and the software is flushed out. Is this news to you?. I don't like new things so I've never used gestures. There's like 10% of apps that support it. 90% of the time you have to tap the damn icon in the top-left corner. If that's better in your book then I've nothing else to say.. I have ""copy image location"" and that allows more compatibility with apps that expect text in the text field and not an image.. You can copy paste images on ios.... Security on android is a complete mess. Mainly due to various OEMS like MIUI, One UI, Oxygen OS. Everybody has their own app for every purpose and has all kinds of 'analytics' in them.

Every manufacturer installs his apps as system apps with all permissions turned on, uninstallable, full network connection permissions and thus greatly increases the attack vector.. True that's what I said. True, I should have said it in another way but English is not really my first or second language, what I mean is that I think with root you are more flexible than with ios as off jailbreak is a ""hack"" which apple doesn't support while some companies actually don't mind rooting and it's easy to update even with root..

Maybe I forgot some things, and this is just basic stuff. I'm using an S10e, so I assume it would be flushed out. Huh.. Yes. It's been in ios for eternity. Then you should edit out ""because not made by google"" unless it is satire. Android OS itself have caught up with iOS in terms of security though I can't vouch for every oem as well.. Security comes from the Android core, I don't think that's something OEM's change with their skin, also for videos iPhone definitely has the win, but I would give the photo win to the Google Pixel. That’s only with certain android manufacturers that don’t have very good security, but google pixels and Samsung and big name brand phones have decent security. Yes, that is also true. But think of it this way: Android; when it comes to updating firmware, is held on the upper hand, since pretty much everyone can create their own custom builds with the open-source operating system. iOS, when it comes to customization, dominates Android with its tweaks due to Objective Type-C's customizability. To be honest, I love both operating systems, but iOS's UI, especially iOS 13, and iOS's capability military-grade encryption, continues to amaze me. Steve Jobs really did a great Job on Apple.. That's weird, I'm on a S10e aswell, and it works great for me so idk. You're welcome. The google part was for privacy. I've changed it now. Was confusing before. OEMS change core for their own purposes

https://www.androidheadlines.com/2020/02/samsung-android-kernel-google-not-happy.html. Android included those 'certain android manufacturers'

So you shouldnt just expect top security with every android. But you can expect top security that hardware can offer with iOS.. Huh.. Apple isn't google free by default.

You are still tracked by google. Unless apple decides to change things.

Plus you said 

Privacy *and* security. That’s my point, not every android device has good or bad security.. 'Privacy or security because it's made by google' sounds dumb and wrong.

That's a default search engine. Which can be changed without sending anything to google.. >'Privacy or security because it's made by google' sounds dumb and wrong.

Agree. 

>That's a default search engine. Which can be changed without sending anything to google.

You can delete all gapps from Android as well. Though I would say majority don't change default settings hence Microsoft and Google faced lawsuit against putting Chrome and IE as default browser. 

People also tend to use Google maps over Apple maps. And google photos since it has unlimited storage. 

The only reason why I pointed out is because people always take a jab at google by saying it is just an insecure mess and never state the other side of story.. Yes you can  delete google apps from and Android with some not so easy measures.

But you cannot delete google play services, which pings google servers 1300 times in a second if you turn WiFi off on my phone. If Google Play services isn't  installed, half the apps crash (even though they don't need it) and you don't receive notifications.. I can agree to disagree that is it.. > But you cannot delete google play services, which pings google servers 1300 times in a second if you turn WiFi off on my phone.

[Yes you can](https://grapheneos.org/).

>If Google Play services isn't installed, half the apps crash (even though they don't need it)

Then use the other half. That's still plenty.

>and you don't receive notifications.

This is just false.. You can agree to anything you want. I just stated what I have observed. You can delete play services. I've gone months without it. But it is not convinient. Atleast for me. Your experience may be better.

The other half of apps are unfortunately not to my style. Otherwise I would have used them.

You don't receive notifications. 95% of the app store use Firebase by Google. Which is reliant on play services.

When an app is in restricted battery mode, play services is pinged by the Firebase server of the app ( eg:reddit ). Then play services wakes up reddit and reddit connects to the server, and then you get notifications.. Then how come you still receive notifications on GrapheneOS when there is no Google in it?

>You can delete play services. I've gone months without it. But it is not convinient. Atleast for me. Your experience may be better.

You're pivoting. Your original comment said:

>But you *cannot delete google play services*. Because those apps keep running in the background, checking for notifications. That's an extremely bad thing for battery. 

An app cannot wake it self from battery restrictions. When an app's server receives notifications for you, the servers tells google, google tells the play services on your phone, and play services wakes up the app, and the app then connects to the server to get the notifications.

Please read the whole paragraph I wrote in the original comment. You're merely stating a single sentence. I continued to state reasons why not running GPlay Services, might be a bad experience for normal people, who are not extremely paranoid about privacy. some people prefer functionality, over privacy, when taken to extreme measures.. Except people usually report the battery life to be longer on Graphene than on stock. Kinda makes the whole part with the server and pinging fall apart.

>Please read the whole paragraph I wrote in the original comment. You're merely stating a single sentence.

I read it. Don't state things in a misleading way. You should've said ""I don't want to delete Google Play Services"" instead of ""You can't delete Google Play Services."" That is dishonest at best.",3446.0,19,3,1
700,Recovering permanently deleted photos,gzohgt,2020-06-09 14:44:28,"How do I recover photos that are permanently deleted? I don’t have them in recently deleted anymore since they expired, I know there’s a way to get them back but how?",5,0.86,12.0,"There is no way to get them back. Otherwise, it wouldn't be permanent.. If this was very recent you *might* be able to find them with something like recuva (windows). If not it's most likely overwritten already.

Looked it up and if you saved the pictures on your internal then you'd have to be rooted in order to be able to mount the phone so that recuva picks it up. If they were on an SD card just get a card reader.. If we were dealing with a computer hard disk, there might be a sliver of hope. But on a phones storage? No chance. I dare say it's not impossible, but you'd need some kind of specialist equipment that only government agencies possess.. Check for thumbnail data. If it's not overwritten or cleared you can recover most of your photos.. You're SOL. If they're expired from sitting that long, the disk space is certainly overwritten by now.. Look up data recovery apps and services.  These are more effective when new data hasn't been written to the storage.. Try Diskdigger. 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.defianttech.diskdigger

If your phone is rooted it will work better though it also works without root.

(I used it before and it seemed like it was working). Try Dumpster app. I don't know of Android version but recuva for be windows does exactly this. I reckon you could use recuva to scan the phone.

How widows and MacOS works is it doesn't actually delete your data. It deleted the reference to it.

Imagine your hard drive as a warehouse. At the front door of the warehouse is a manager. People come into the warehouse with photos, apps, updates etc (think yif these as boxes, for later). The manager looks in his book, says put it in section x, shelf y, spot z. This is how computers find where information is on a hard drive.

Now deleting. All that happens is someone walks into the warehouse and says to the manager ""I want to delete x"". So he gets out his book and scores it out. Nobody actually gets the box and throws it out. That's all. The reference to the information is deleted but not the information. It's actually still on the disk.

Obvious question you might ask is ""what happens if someone comes into the warehouse and is told to put their box in one of these spots that's had a box but it's still there."" The box is simply replaced by the new box. 

This is why people say to zero disks or even physically destroy then. Simply reinstalling the OS leaves HUGE chunks of information sitting on the disk. Programmes like recuva simply scan the disk for unreferenced data and shows you what it is. Unfortunately as it's unreferenced, it can't know where it was in your file system, what it's for our anything. It'll just have a huge list of files. Some of which will be incomplete data (a 0.5mb file taking up some space of a 2mb file leave just 1.5mb left of it.. This is a good explanation. And a few others in this thread have said something similar. 

However, and not to sound like a dick... but you're all kind of referencing old info or things that don't generally apply to phones. 

Everyone that keeps talking about how ""data is not actually deleted, only the reference to it"" is accurate. However, with modern use of SSDs and how TRIM works, what you guys are saying doesn't apply 95% of the time. TRIM does in fact delete the file unlike what happens on drives that don't have TRIM enabled. 

This also doesn't take into account that all modern phones use encryption as well. Well I'm assuming the encrypion won't apply once the phone is legitimately accessed by the user. Unless OP doesn't actually have access to the phone. Once access is granted by Android that won't matter.

Also looks like recuva do have an Android too but I can confirm it works from windows to windows to Android with the windows tool. How long TRIM takes to work I don't know, but it worked just now. I didn't wait that long though to be fair.. You also have to consider that it's not in recently deleted anymore. Depending on the device and setup, recently deleted could mean anything from 3 days to 30 days. There's a fair chance that stuff done in the last 30 days have overwritted those chunks of unreferenced data, especially if the storage was close to full.",750.0,4,31,1

Thank you!",1,0.67,2.0,"Nope, there isn't. The main reason for that being the flash storage controller masks all that info - any bad sectors are remapped on-the-fly from the spare pool, without any involvement from the OS.

The second reason is, Android allows no such functionality nor access. A root user could however, boot into recovery and run an ""fsck"", but this only checks the filesystem level and not the physical sectors.

The best course of action to resolve your issue would be to do a full factory reset and see if the issues persist. Typically a factory reset should sort it out.. See dmesg, for example with the PC program ADB, basically the phone explains what's going on at the moment near the hardware, e.g. I/O error dev ___ sector ___.

BetterBatteryStats is super good

Lists kernel wakelocks, partial wakelocks and even application ping alarms. You have to give some permissions via adb tho. that doesn't show battery drain when screen is off exclusively. is there a free version?. You could just charge the phone to 100%, unplug it, then let it sit for an hour or two without using it. The normal battery usage screen would then essentially only show screen off stats since the stats screen clears when the battery is full, and the phone was just sitting there doing nothing after you unplugged it.

I haven't used battery apps in years since I don't have any need for them so not sure if apps like accubattery allow you to isolate just screen off data.. Grab the xda edition from here  :)

https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/sven-knispel/betterbatterystats/betterbatterystats-2-5-341-release/. ah yes I could try that, but I've done it before, and usually the battery just goes down and no apps show up in the list.

I use Accubattery, and it just shows how much battery is gone while the screen is off, doesn't show details.

thanks though!. ohh whats the difference?. Idk.. never tried the paid app lmao :p

Should solve your purpose tho. yes thank you!  
those adb permissions dont have any downsides or anything i should be careful about?. Oh no no nothing to worry about.

(android.permission.BATTERY_STATS) This one gives permission to read system battery statistics..as is the name

(android.permission.DUMP) This one gives permission to read internal state of the system for recording wakelocks and alarms

(android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS) This gives the ""permit usage access"" permission which you usually give from the settings

Which one has more value? considering the 1-year gap between release dates.

I did use syncthing but weirdly enough it most times show that my device is offline and disconnected! That's why I started searching for alternatives!. I would try setting it up again.. It can be a little fickle, especially if your phone runs a long time between reboots.

I use SyncThing-Fork now, it extends the controls a bit.

Also try Resilio, it works similar to ST. Then there's FolderSync, which can sync to SMB/CIFS, FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, etc, so takes a little more setup.. I guess I gotta try again then!. Since I run a custom, which has a few minior bugs, so I do reboot quite often. So guess i should try properly configuring SyncThing. 

Also will try your suggestions!

I have a Oneplus 5T, it runs LineageOS 16.0 (latest update) which is based on Android Pie. I run Nova as my launcher.

My problem: Very often when switching apps I get a blank screen, meaning the app I was switching to is not showing anything.

This happens either by using the ""Recent Apps"" switcher or by tapping a notification. And it mostly happens when I switch from a 3D App (games like PoGo, Ingress and similar) to a 2D app (like Telegram or even the phone app when a call is incoming).  Infact, the most often occurence of this is me being in PoGo, getting a Telegram notification, tapping it, boom, blank screen. 

Sometimes I can fix it by force closing f.e. telegram and restarting it, but often the ""Recent Apps"" view which I use to force close apps starts showing a blank screen to, so I have to reboot.

Sadly camera API is a mess in any Android phone, most of the time only the stock camera app gives you best result and I am not sure recording at 4:3 would give you a better picture, but if you insist to record to 4:3 then Open Camera can do it for you..

Like for me all cameras are the same, and all photos of the same quality. 

Sure I can tell between a national geographic photo and a selfie, but I lack finesse. I don't know how much megapixels matter, how to judge if a photo is good, so I lack the confidence in picking a good phone.",8,0.79,5.0,"You could start by looking at the actual object and the picture and see which one is more accurate. 

You could see how dark the shadows are. 

If you click a landscape picture with alot of colours check which picture is more accurate w the colours (dynamic range)

In the higher tier phones like Pixel v. iPhones .It honestly is personal choice. For eg. I find pixel photos to be a bit cold but most like that.. Well tbh at this point all flagship phones camera quality is very close.

To access a picture you can check several things like 

How bright is the brightest part of image?

How dark are the dark parts of image?

Does the image have realistic colors? Some phones saturate image. 

In case of selfie, how is the skin? Does it look natural? Is the color of skin right? Is it too smoothed out?

Also try zooming in images and notice distant objects.. As for the megapixels ... Basically if you increase your megapixels you can get more detail but it comes with a price. 

Higher the megapixels ... More storage it will take because there's more information. This is why most phones do something called binnig. Basically a full 64mp photo is too big for your phone so they take 4 pixels as one pixel and make it a 16 mp photo.

Higher megapixels also means worse low-light performance.

Higher megapixels also means a bigger camera sensor causing bigger camera bumps and Samsung was facing alot of focus issues w their 108mp main camera because of how big the sensor was.

The best config I've seen is samsung s20. 12MP main and Ultra wide for perfect ratio of detail to low light performance. 64 MP telephoto because that's where detail counts and it allows for better digital zoom.

Check this [video](https://youtu.be/vFSi3AA5ulU) for more detailed explanation of why 12 mp.. How much objectivity is there in it? For example, every review I watch says Samsung needs to step up their photo game, but when using just the normal photo mode, I prefer the look of my Note 10+ to my girlfriend's XS Max. To be honest I feel like if a photo makes me happy it is good enough. Most reviewers keep a lot of things in mind like editing potential and how much information can the photo hold. In reviews even if the camera is 99% there they tend to talk about the 1% that's left and well that's their job. But these cameras are solid and you're not missing out on much.",420.0,13,86,1

Is there no mute button on note?. Press mute.. I believe it's so you can't accidentally mute a phone call.  There should be a mute button though on most phone apps.  But I will agree, it's annoying. Not all apps have a mute button.

I was on a conference call using the avaya spaces app, and I was in the room with someone else also on the call, and since there is no mute button, I can only turn the volume down, and there was no way to turn it all the way down. So whenever the person next to me spoke, there was an annoying echo.. To clarify: You want to be unable to hear the distant party, right?. because there's no point to being able to turn the other person's volume to zero. take the phone away from your ear. there, you can't here them now. or just put them on hold. Some call apps doesn't have that option unfortunately. Even pressing to decrease and also putting the phone in silent mode decreasing all types of volume still doesnt work, in a call it always stops at a minimum level.. And not all apps has a mute option.... Even pressing to decrease and also putting the phone in silent mode decreasing all types of volume still doesnt work, in a call it always stops at a minimum level.. EXACTLY, why a limit to this?. Yes, not necessarily unable to hear but the capacity to lower voices without system limitation. :/ Sometimes at minimum volume the other person voice is so loud, I don't get why I cant set my volume to 1 for example. Android don't allow me to make that choises. Doesn't all the default calls have that?

Wait are you using voice calls on an internet app?. Which call apps are you using specifically?. You're trying to not hear the person talking to you?. Do you even know what the **mute** button is?

If you are trying **to silent the other person's voice** *AND* **silent your voice in the call, press the HOLD button.**

If you are trying **to silent YOUR OWN voice press the MUTE button.**

If you are trying **to silent ONLY THE OTHER PERSON'S VOICE,** *then that can't be done.*

You never know which will come in handy at the next moment, so you need to try it out yourself.. Ah! You want to bring it lower than the system lets you. I can see that! What a silly limitation.. Tell them to take a phone out of their mouth then lol

Whatever the lowest volume it lets you go to would be considered 1. Any lower would be zero so you wouldn't hear them at all.. Probably something like google hangouts or duo, I use duo all the time for video calls. It can be annoying at times not being able to mute the call and not just myself.. Yubo for example is an app that have live transmission and my phone thinks that is a dialing app so i cant set to 0 my audio. :/ Sometimes at minimum volume the other person voice is so loud, I don't get why I cant set my volume to 1 for example.. YES, very silly. Get it 😂. With earphones is even worse.. oh, that is weird, but I think you need to ask the other person to turn *their* volume down, because maybe it affects the mic volume aswell.. It reminds me of Android products that have steps for volume. If it were a knob, you could choose 0, 1, 2, 3... and nothing in between! Who *wants* that? What if I need volume set to 2.1753948?

Oh, and another thing! Why, when I turn brightness all the way down, can the system make it even **dimmer!** You know: at 5% battery power, it dims the display darker than any setting I'm allowed to use. **I want it darker.**

Harrumph!. That's true, I will test this. Hahaha, so true. In iOS you can use a filter (Android can do that too I think) that makes even darker the screen, but why can't we do that already in brightness setting?",706.0,11,65,1

796,Should I swap a Samsung Galaxy S7 for a Honor 9x?,gymhkk,2020-06-07 22:45:24,"Please tell me your thoughts on the positives and negatives.

&#x200B;

Edit: I said swap in the title, but it's likely I'll be able to sell my phone for 100-200, on the lower end and the 9x costs 150.

&#x200B;

The phones:

[https://www.kimovil.com/en/where-to-buy-huawei-honor-9x](https://www.kimovil.com/en/where-to-buy-huawei-honor-9x)

[https://www.kimovil.com/en/where-to-buy-samsung-galaxy-s7-eu](https://www.kimovil.com/en/where-to-buy-samsung-galaxy-s7-eu)",2,0.75,40.0,"my quick reaction would no, the s7 has a 1440p  AMOLED   screen vs IPS 1080p , but the Honor does have USB C and a better camera and bigger battery , and Android 9 not sure what the s7 has now it came with 6. what size memory /storage on each phone?. Yes the screen is nice but it is 5.1inch and the 9x around 6.6inch at 84% coverage. Having usb-c is probably more an issue currently. I have 0 cable for usb-c. Does it support hdmi over usb-c? I think it doesn't as its an older version of usb-c.

Samsung dropped hdmi out support with the s7 and I would like to have that again. But it is not a deciding factor.

My battery is currently 70% of its orginal. or 2000mah estimated capacity with 3000mah design capacity. The 9x has 4000mah, but a large battery isn't always better, battery optimization play a large role.

I think s7 is currently Android 8.0.

Also I said swap in the title, but it's likely I'll be able to sell my phone for 100-200, on the lower end and the 9x costs 150.  


Edit: the 9x is USB-C 2.0 (OTG) and I don't really know what that means. Also I've heard USB-C connectors are weaker than Mirco-USB so I don't know if I'm looking forward to the future of USB-C.. Samsung s7 32GB storage and 4GB memory. 

9x 128GB storage and 4GB memory.. 70 percent is pretty bad, I feel obliged to mentioned that when I sold it, maybe the bigger screen and its much newer   battery   tips the balance in the honours favour , here you you could get around 100 pounds for a s7 no way 200. I have crap eyes I wouldnt like to use a 5 inch screen for long , the honor 9x is worth more on ebay here than the s7. USB-C cables and connectors are much stronger than micro-USB.

As the tips ofUSB-C cables are less-flimsy, it does not get damaged easily.

USB-C is also easier to insert into the port, which means the USB-C port is less-likely to get damaged like a micro-usb port, where the csble-tip will have to be inserted in a more precise click, where people unintentionally tend to press too hard.. if you do lots of micro managing because of the 32gb , get the 9x , I wouldnt be happy losing the AMOLED 1440p though. all you're really gaining is some space , which you could off-set with a sdcard , and swamping is a risk if you dont know the person , im not sure I would bother, if the s7 is working OK. Yeah luckily I don't use it much and always have a battery pack available if I'm caught out. AccuBattery say's at 100% it is about 4 hours with screen on and 45 hours with screen off. It feels like a larger difference than it actually is.  


Yeah hopefully I can find a 9x in store to compare to the two.. Yeah I think I might be lucky to sell it for the same price as an 9x. I wonder what will be easier to sell / worth more in a year though?. I am very lucky, I have my laptop connected to a 55inch 2160p screen. Viewing at less than 2 meters on the couch. Struggling to find a use case for my phone tbh, but might be nicer to have something new.. Same here, though I am using a lifeproof case which someone distorts the screen, but it has saved the phone atleast a dozen times.

I'm not sure I can get a case of equal quality for the 9x and I am not sure how I feel about spending 50%-100% of the price of the phone on a case. Are 9x parts affordable and accessible? I would rather self-repair a screen for 30 than spend 80 on a case.

I have a 32GB MicroSD card, other than that being close to full no issues with the 32GB on the phone. I could clear that for more space, but need to invest in more backup storage first.. Sorry I didn't make it clear in the title, I would sell my phone and then buy the 9x, probably having to put in $$ and selling the phone would be a hassle. S7 is working great, really should get a larger sd card though. I like the large screen on the 9x, pop up camera (no notch) and 3.5mm jack and 128GB base storage. The camera is an upgrade and I'm not using my phone for multimedia consumption much, it's probably most useful to me as a camera to me so it could be an upgrade there? Though I barely use it for that - and it seems the 9x doesn't have video stabilization, shoots in 1080p and mine shoots in 2160p and not sure about stabilization.. I handled a s7 recently nice phone be hard to beat build quality wise. The market is smart people will pay what's it's  worth I wouldn't worry about that. Yes technically getting the newer phone is reducing risk.  I dont think the case and parts will be an issue  , the honor 9x was a popular phone. I don't think hassle is worth it for a side ways move maybe sell spend a bit  and get a  s8. Yeah it's been great, unbreakable in a lifeproof case. I upgraded from the s5. Still missing the infrared port and recently wanted to use hdmi out, but samsung dropped support for it in the s6 and s7, not sure if they've brought it back.. Yeah and 2 years warranty, but should be useless on a new phone unless you get accident insurance as well.. It's a shame it doesn't have the 810, it is a like 40% more performance than the 710f, but maybe that is already reflected in the price - which is more of a concern.. s8 looks good, but it looks like it's twice the price or $300 new.   


My key requirements are not to spend any money, or at least very little. For the phone to have no notch and a 3.5mm jack. I found the 9x because it was the lowest priced phone to meet this criteria, when also selecting for 128GB+ storage.  


I think I would prefer to have a pop up camera, but I am not sure that matters, probably between 60-70% sure on this. Would be nice to know someone can't access it though.. Nah infra red is long gone :). I've blagged a few repairs after breaking something , but yeah insurance needed. I don't the CPU difference matters much with light use. I have background in Engineering and I would avoid pop-up cameras is just another thing that can break, probably a pain to fix as well. yes im having to dodge the s20 , no headphone jack, I refuse to buy a phone without one. I think the 9x has it.. Now I think of it I did need to get the s7 repaired under warranty once as the charge port fried, either due to residual water or a broken charger / combination of both.   


It would probably be worthwhile to have a device under warranty again.. The only reason I spend a large amount for the s7 was because I couldn't stand the frustration of slow loading devices, that was the norm on cheap devices a few years ago - not so much now.  


I imagine the CPU should hold up for the next few years, but could be wrong, and I can't stand slow or incapable devices.. I don't watch TV so see no use for it. Ha my S10 just fried for the same reason. problem is theres more to a phone than the cpu, what about the ram and the flash ?storage , perhaps a top their phone like the s7 is better than a newer mid-range phone in those areas , its normally the battery charge loss that slows down phones alway, takes a long time for top tier phone cpu to be too slow for standard apps Imho. Same though I probably find myself in a few waiting areas where I wouldn't mind turning a TV off.. Hopefully they cover it!  


I'd taken my phone windsurfing - being alone and new to the sport I carried my phone for emergency. The lifeproof case isn't that great and water got it. The phone survived that but later on that day when it went flat I tried charging it with a friends charger, and the normal pop up didn't display, I left it plugged in hoping it would charge, but in the end something was wrong and it never turned back on.   


It probably didn't charge because it detected water, or my friends charger sucked, I am not sure now if the charger was working with other phones.. Ha. It seems it allows some charge through when wet enough to fry things. So much for that IP68 rating lol. yeah its almost bullcrap",1533.0,11,38,1

Fair bit of messing about though. Download/install the app on whatever device you want, use an APK extractor, transfer the APK to the desired device, install.

My old device was a Samsung Galaxy J3 Prime (same carrier). It was maybe 3 y/o, but the screen got cracked. It's semi-usable and I was able to backup to PC using SmartSwitch. I've Googled the below questions.   

I read the quick start guide and it says to remove tray and insert SIM card + microSD card then plug up to charge for a few hours before first use.      

I need to unmount the microSD card from my current device using the settings menu before putting it into my new device, correct?

The SIM card I have is the small one. nanoSIM I believe. Will my old text messages and contacts transfer if I use the new one that came in the box? What's the purpose of it anyway?    

Also, will my text messages transfer if I use the new one that came in the box? or will they transfer in the first place? I was using the native/stock Samsung messaging app for text messages.

* my phone to automatically start charging when I plug in a USB cable *while simultaneously* giving me a USB Connection notification where I can switch it from charging to File Transfer.

More often than not, it won't start charging and it won't give me a notification, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get to the USB Connection Settings by browsing through the settings menus. 

I'll have to turn off the phone and then it will charge fine, meaning there's no lint in the USB port causing connection issues. 

Sometimes it does give me a hidden notification when I pull down to check for it, and quite often when I click it, it is set to USB Controlled by Connected Device, instead of by the phone. When I try to switch it to phone, it'll switch for a few seconds before switching back to Connected Device. Even when I do get it to stick on either option, the actual USB option menu below it is [greyed out](https://imgur.com/ELVmIYi)

Sometimes it will toggle between the two, sounding the charging notification beep every 5 seconds or so.

I've been pulling my hair out for a while now, and I've found several threads online where tons of people have very similar issues accross all types of devices, including high-end Pixels and Samsung phones.

I am at my wit's end, so I decided to factory reset my phone. Before doing so I wanted to export my pics and files ( *is this really needed? What will be gone after a factory reset? Apps, login info, account info?* ) 
But guess what, I still haven't been able to get my Mac to recognize the phone and have been unable to transfer anything.

I've also enabled developer options and tried switching the USB DEFAULT options there, to no avail. I must have rebooted my phone like twelve times this morning.

Note, these issues started a few weeks ago, before then I never had any of these issues.

Am I wrong to think that charging the phone and transferring files should be very basic functions of a mobile phone and should just work **consistently** without having to enable a secret developer options menu while getting utterly frustrated? Google doesn't seem to have an answer from what I can tell. What gives?

I know their is a tone of apps that can do that BUT they all require the pc and the phone to be on the same network, something i can't do because i'm in a university accommodation where i can't connect my phone and my pc to the same network.   
So i know Wifi-Direct exist, and from what I understand it doesn't need the two devices to be on the same network, i mean that's one of its advantages so... But i only can find app that require both devices to be on the same network. Also it's seems that is possible to mirror an Android screen to a pc (using true wifi-direct) but i can't find the opposite.  
So this is where I am, if anyone knows an app that can you REAL Wifi-Direct for mirroring my PC screen to my phone it would be great ! And if you don't, do you think its possible to achieve something like this ? If it's not feel free to explain me why, i am curious about.

Spacedesk kinda a require both devices to be on the same network, but making a WiFi hotspot with my phone and connecting to it on my pc make the thing work, but yeah with some good lag.

822,[Rant/Help] My Note 8 might be on it's last legs and I need help with a decision...,gyfa1b,2020-06-07 16:20:33,"I was very happy with my Note 8 when I got it, and, in spite of some of the issues I've had with the fact that Samsung isn't stock Android, I haven't had a lot of regret about it. However, the device is getting older and I have been fine with using it for as long as I can.

Recently (about two to three months ago) I began having issues with the charging port until it eventually failed entirely.

I never really had to deal with phone repairs. The local tech guy I trust doesn't do phones so he referred me to Staples. 

Staples didn't repair it on site, so I had to wait a week and a half without a phone while they fixed it. They also made me sign something releasing them from liability from any damage to the phone.

In the end, when I got it back, the new charging port seemed to be working fine and I assumed I'd be able to keep the phone for another year or two before worrying about having to get something new. 

Yesterday I noticed my phone was again having issues with the charging port. It hasn't failed completely, but it keeps telling me it's not getting enough charge and giving full charge estimates of 25 hours. It charges wirelessly just fine.

Honestly I don't want to deal with Staples again. My expectation is that they will offer to repair it again, but I don't want to deal with another week and a half of waiting, only to possibly have to deal with yet another faulty charging pin. I use my phone too much to be comfortable with wireless charging only. Even though I use it a lot, it took quite awhile before I had an issue with the pin. I have no reason to believe that the latest pin issue is my fault.

But now I don't know what to do... ***should I find a better repair place to bring it to? Or should I just set up the phone as mobile device for my son to use and just replace the phone outright?*** I don't really enjoy having to replace the phone as I am someone who benefits from having a phone of a high quality, but that comes with a commensurate price increase that makes it difficult to afford them outright, but that's my best option when it comes to purchasing phones at the moment.

She has been mentioning lately that it keeps saying her storage space is running out. Got her an SD card, only to realize MIUI doesn't let you move apps to SD card (without root anyways). But that's not the point of this post.

While messing around in TotalCommander, I noticed that the storage space on ""Internal Storage"" is capped at 9.7GB. The advertised storage space of this model is 16GB. Open up storage manager in Settings, add up the categories and something similar comes up. 1.6GB free, (as said on top) and around 8GB used. Still says ""Total: 16.00GB"" though.

Has anyone run into this? I don't want to buy her a new phone after a year or so because of this. Rooting would preferably be a last resort.",1,0.67,4.0,"Unfortunately companies advertise the total amount of raw flash storage (the ’size' of the chips themselves), but you have to count file system overhead (e.g. you have to store what file is where in the chips, in a kind of lookup table / table of contents, among others), usually after this you have 13-14 GBs left.

On top of this,  the system itself takes up space from the 16GB as well. So this leaves you with 9-10GB actually usable.

The most likely reason phone manufacturers don't let you put Apps on SD cards, is because they're extremely slow compared to the internal storage, so when you want to load an app from it, loading times are multiples of what it would otherwise be, and most likely to the average user that marks the whole phone as 'slow'.

Nowadays I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy a phone with less than 32GBs of storage (which usually have about 25GBs usable), And I would go for 64 or more for myself, but that's for my personal use.. That's about right, most 16gb devices nowadays only have around 7-8gb usable storage.

Unfortunately, nowadays a 16gb device is just barely enough to run modern Android, and I know of two manufacturers (HMD Nokia and Motorola) who have offered ""16GB"" Android Go devices that don't actually have 16gb..
Example.
The Nokia One Plus has only 14.9GB whilst the Moto E5 play has 14.3 GB...... neither device has the amount of storage advertised.

The absolute minimum anyone should consider now is 32gb because it gives you well over 20gb of usable storage, and doesn't cost much more that the same 16gb version of the same device.. Because the System take ~5GB, depends on the system, so it's normal. That phone is 4 years old at this point and 16GB are barely useable with modern app sizes.",303.0,5,145,1

You need one UI 2/2.1 for your device if you want the official Samsung update.
You can get Odin (ROM flasher) and the update from sammobile. (Trusted)

FYI

*Android Go is NOT designed for high end flagship devices like a galaxy note 8.*

You need a ""regular"" Android version.

First, if you have a US carrier locked device, you can forget updating to android 10, as US carrier locked Samsung's CANNOT be bootloader unlocked so you can't flash any ROMs.
There's currently NO workaround or fix.

Secondly, if you don't have a US carrier locked device, goto XDA and search the note 8 threads for Android 10 custom ROMs
Full instructions on flashing are provided in the individual posts.

If you like 120Hz but you don't care to have an LCD, go for it
But if you like the colors of an AMOLED, then you know what to do

But keep in mind that the AMOLED burn with the time, if you have an old phone with AMOLED, try to display a white picture on all the screen, you'll see the icons of the task bar, like the hour, the wifi and cellular power, the battery and all the notification icon that weren't deleted. 100% AMOLED. High refresh rates are way over hyped, and you can barely even see a difference. It doesn't matter. Black that is not grey, however, does matter. I have an AMOLED display, and it's very nice.. I'd pick a 60hz OLED. AMOLED screens are the most beautiful screens you can get. They'll run LCD's for you though, lol. 90hz AMOLED. If the AMOLED was only 60hz I might lean towards the LCD, but when it's already high refresh rate? I think the benefits of AMOLED outweigh the extra 30hz. 

(For what it's worth, I love my 120hz screen and think it looks significantly better than 90hz. But AMOLED is still more important.)

Though really, you need to judge by the entire phone. Make sure the rest of the AMOLED phone is good lol.. 30mhz meh don't factor that in choose for other reasons, I would go for amoled myself, I hate grey blacks. Thank you.. Thank you. I haven't ever owned a device with an Amoled screen. Would love to get one.. I haven't ever owned a device with Amoled display. I would love to have a nice looking display. What do you think?. same, I hate black on my LCD screen. If you want to have a bright screen, with deep blacks, better battery life but knowing that in 1 and half year you'll have burn mark on it, yeah, an AMOLED is good for all of this, but if you think that the burn mark will make you insane, take the LCD. Is it necessary that every amoled screen will get a burn mark?. not really, my xiaomi mi 8 se will be 2 years old this august and not a single burn mark.. From what I know, every AMOLED get a burn mark if there's always something displayed on the screen that doesn't move, like the logo of a TV channel (even the AMOLED of TVs get burned) or the task bar on android. Absolutely not. I've had 4 different AMOLED devices and not one of them has burn in. The oldest got used for 3+years, used constantly. Just don't disable the screen time out. That's great. Do you heavily use your device?. yes, I always turn off the screen whenever I'm not using it, I think this is the thing that many people don't do with their amoled phones and btw I don't use the always on feature..

First, download the wanted version (it's a 3GB file, so download it with the wifi)

Select your language and select ""install from internal storage"" then search for your file and click on it, click ""ok"" and it start to install

860,Low latency wireless earbuds?,gy4ajh,2020-06-07 02:31:17,"My powerbeats pro are slowly starting to crap out on me, and Im wondering if there are any wireless earbuds that don't have delay.",9,0.92,12.0,"Check out if buds support aptx before purchasing a new one. There are some things to look out for. Other comments aren't entirely well-informed.

Any wireless earbuds with a modern codec like AptX (HD) or AAC will not have latency when doing non-realtime stuff like watching a youtube video. This is because although there is a delay, the delay is communicated back to your phone and the video is synced up by delaying it the same amount. Works like a charm.

However, if you want to play games or make music or whatever with wireless headphones, you will get a delay. The only codec at this time that addresses this is AptX Low Latency. But on the wireless headphones I've tried the latency is still noticeable, though a lot less. So although ""good"" options exist I would really recommend you try them out with a real-time task before purchasing. If the latency is a lot less but still enough to be annoying you might still prefer a wired option.. Most of the new models should be without delay, but to be sure just make sure the headphones support aptx, which is the low latency codec that they use in most modern headphones. I think Samsung uses their own version, ssc. Aac is Apple's version. Ldac is also good.

Any headphones made in the last year *should* support one of these low latency codecs. I've had great results with the original Galaxy Buds since they launched and have heard nothing but good things about the Buds+ to the point where I constantly think about picking up a pair even though my originals are still going strong.. After the fist comment that's the first thing I check.. Ah, okay. I don't play games or make music with my phone, and if I ever do it's with a pair of over hear headphones. Thank you for the warning!. Okay, thank you! That's good to know.. If I had a Samsung phone I'd pick one up, went for the OnePlus 7 pro though.. Great 👍. Happy to help! A realtime use case I forgot is video calling, which always has some delay, but less is always better IMO. The Galaxy Buds work for the OnePlus. You can download the app off the PlayStore. The only thing you lose is SSC support (Samsung Scalable Codec). You still get AAC though which is good codec.. Galaxy buds don't offer anything unique for Samsung phone owners though?",407.0,4,24,1

Ask your relative where they got the phone.. check the system properties to find the hardware model number and firmware revision.  Does it have a Dual-SIM slot?

&#x200B;

It's more than likely a Chinese-market hardware revision, which means it defaults to Chinese language, Chinese carrier firmware, and 3/4 of the radios onboard are useless outside China because they're the wrong frequency for cellular carriers elsewhere.  So if you are using the phone in Europe or North America, you're getting worse coverage and speed than a domestic phone because your phone likely only supports 2 or 3 common radio bands of a half-dozen the carrier may be using.

Almost every phone model has a half-dozen or more different hardware versions for South Korea, China, EMEA and the Americas, usually with a short-bus version specifically for Verizon as well because the radio frequencies and bands are different and the CPU integration and performance is different too.  And each model requires a different OS firmware image, mostly not compatible.  THAT'S why OTA Android upgrades take so long to release, because they're not only different per phone model but down to your carrier as well.",201.0,13,65,1

-Is this referring to the name of the device that is downloading and using app? Or the names of any and all of the devices using a specific Wifi network access point?

Apps can't see the WiFi networks around you unless you've granted location permission (there are databases that map WiFi networks to location, so you can actually determine someone's location given a list of WiFi networks).

In this case, I think that ""WiFi devices"" refers to the connected devices on the same network (like IoT devices and such). I think this permission is intended so that apps like Philips Hue and Sonos can communicate with their respective devices on your local network.

As for vulnerabilities, I'm not sure there are too many (but bear in mind that I'm not 100% sure as to what this permission gives access to). AFAIK it's a little like letting apps through Windows Firewall--it lets the app communicate on your local network.

Well I’ve done a few of those and some work and some don’t, but I can’t get it to update to the last current version compatible with my device. For some reason those APK ones don’t have the full playstore. I also don’t even know what the last compatible version would be. My tablet says firmware version 2.3.5 and kernel 2.6.35.7

So I had to download an APK for fire fox. now it says google play is installed on my device but I can’t find it anywhere on it. If you don't have play services installed then you cannot update the play store also some apps won't work . Try site loading it via finding apk of it available for your android version..

And nothing else has an update option anywhere that I can see. I’m about to just throw the damn thing away after smashing it into a billion pieces. Not like it’s good for anything anymore anyways. Even the default web browser won’t open the google play website because the browser isn’t supported. Thanks bud I appreciate your help.. After seeing all the info you told me I came to the conclusion that , maybe support for Google Play services ( Google mobile services ) is revoked by google for your device mainly because it runs a old version of Android and if it has a older processor it may not able to run never android APPS and and support new API's . 

Kindly use Aurora store or fdroid for your application needs .
Also try replacing apps running over Google Play services to  apps those do not need Google Play services to run . 

Fdroid apps mostly don't need Google Play services and they're pretty safe some also some basic , functionality based , straightforward apps in fdroid do not internet permission .. Idk what happened. I realized my first problem could’ve been eliminated by turning off my 2FA. Had I just done that and never reformatted the damn thing it would still be working just fine. Idk why I can’t get it to download anything properly from the restart. Other than everything is so old equally that it has no starting place to update. I’m frustrated and angry and just want to play damn spaceflight simulator. But the freaking update isn’t out for IOS yet because their vetting process takes longer than Android. Otherwise this tablet can go back into the drawer where I left it..  try your luck and try 2 things that might help -

1) go to settings and application then find if Google Play Store ( android market ) and Google Play services are there and then clear their cache and data . And restart you device once .
Then try doing update .

2) go to settings try finding Google service framework
( com.google.android.gsf ) and try clearing data of it and then try to update .. I can clear the cache on both of those but there is no “update” option. And when I clear the cache on the market and open it’s that’s when I get the TOS issue I mentioned earlier. One sec I’ll make a video

Edit: [here](https://youtu.be/rWANJpeC9uA)  is what happens when I open market after a factory reset. After seeing that video I can speculate that support for Google Play services has been revoked for that certain android version because its been too old for now and new apps and API's .

The data is in the wrong order for security, format data would return it into the right order but would **delete everything.**


There is no correct unroot. Closest would be flashing the official Android (stock rom aka stock firmware) with the PC program Odin then locking the bootloader.

After installing anything custom with an unlocked bootloader, the phone considers itself compromised (known as Knox trip), and Samsung Pass, Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, Secure Folder, Knox job-related apps, and Warranty are permanently revoked even after unrooting. Knox is separate from the safetynet and sysscope state.. On android 9? It's not possible. Your phone will get wiped when you unlock the bootloader.",190.0,20,246,1

882,Why can't I move all apps to the SD card?,gxw6zf,2020-06-06 18:23:07,"Hi.

A relative has an Android phone that's low on internal storage space. There's plenty of free space on the Micro SD Card. However, there's only a few apps that I could move to the SD card - Telegram, Lite, etc. Why can't the other apps be moved to the SD card? Is there a workaround?

Thanks.",24,0.9,22.0,"In developer settings, there should be an option for something like ""Force Allow Apps On External"" it forces them to go on the SD card, though you may get run into some issues. As nice of an option that would be for convenience, it's unfortunately not a realistic one. Think about heat. Your smartphone's memory, processor, GPU, and other core components are passively cooled. Doing so increases longevity of your device and safety. Your memory card doesn't have such options. Constantly running sequential reads and writes to it will significantly degregate your memory card and future reduce it's usefulness. In short, I'd recommend storage only for memory cards in addition to a cloud storage option with(if possible), local backups on a trusted computer at home. Google Photos is a convenient option for cloud storage and with Android, already installed on your phone. Open Google Photos (the pinwheel looking icon), head to the options with the three lines at the top left, settings, backup and sync. If you have unlimited data, then enable backup over Data for both pictures and videos. 
Anyway, my two cents.
Cheers mate.. Because devs didn't program in that code.. This is one of the reasons I don't use expandable storage on my devices. And I've had issues of SD card getting corrupted and losing data. Evo and S4 had this issue.   


But Android, Google, and Assistant has been really disappointing lately.. Just be mindful of what you put there. Apps you move may not work properly. Background processes might never run. Could be a problem for certain apps. Here are the reasons:

https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/install-location

It's just too many, that a lot of apps shouldn't allow it unless they have some special fallbacks. For most developers it's not worth the extra work, because it also means to keep supporting yet another aspect of the app, for each new and existing feature they have.

Also, as written there, an app is allowed to be installed on the SD-card only if the developers marked it as such, which means they are ok with that as they've (probably) tested it themselves, that nothing goes wrong when you do it.

As a side note, moving to SD-card makes the app usually load everything slower, as SD-cards are usually slower than internal storage. Not sure how much slower though.. Memory card mainly to keep media only. It's because external memories form have the same speed, that's the most important. There are many other technical reasons, like some app component that can't be ran outside an internal memory due to security, but there are apps, old ones like Apps2SD. I suggest you invest in a phone with plenty internal memory. Easiest way.. Thanks, all.. I'm not sure, but as far as I remember, those apps couldn't be moved to SD card that run services in the background, or need autostart.

I had a Galaxy S2 back in the day, and this was my problem.

A tip: Use AppMgr III (App 2 SD) for this.. Google sucks and they hate external storage.

Every time the apps update anyway they will move back to the phone and you'll have to manually move them back to SD.. I have done that, but I still can't move all to external. I would modify the app, but how would I do it? Through the manifest?. Hi SilverLightning926. I enabled dev mode but don't see that option.. I gotta disagree on that one. I've had my tablet running Link2SD for years now without any problems. The metal ""cage"" the card slides into appears to be easily enough to absorb/dissipate the generated heat. In my case the SD has more cooling than the SoC as there's no metal shield on top of it.

Of course there is a slight speed penalty, but the 16GB of internal storage left me with no other choice, and now I'm quite happy with it overall.. ? Are you talking about the phone devs, or the app devs, because it doesn’t have to be coded in the app itself for that.. TY.. Ok. TY.. Hi Bograma. It's not my phone. I have a FP2 running Ubuntu Touch.. Hi kpeter1993. I thought that app would force some apps to move to the SD Card. It only showed the ones that I'd already moved manually before.. Pretty sure it does have to be specified in a manifest.. It has to be coded into the app. Most apps can be moved to external storage but will keep writing their data to internal data because all Android developers seem to be completely brain-dead (the only exceptions I am aware of are Kindle and Google Maps).

Until such a time that the smartphone cartels are smashed (e.g. you can't upgrade internal storage without also buying 47 additional cameras no one could possibly want) your only option is to buy a more expensive flagship phone.. I think the safest apps to move to SD-card are games, because those usually don't have special components . However, they will also probably suffer the most from performance...",834.0,10,55,1

So after some trial and error, I have figured out a common thread that photographs (picture files that were created with my phone camera) are not being sent but other image files seem to pass unencumbered.  For example, if I take a screenshot of my phone screen or send a meme downloaded from reddit, the MMS seems to go through to any contact.  However, if I take a picture of my dinner and try to send it to my contacts, it seems to not go through.  It does not seem to matter if the picture is captured through the text messaging app or my camera app and then uploaded to the Text Messenger app.


Text-based MMS's do not seem unencumbered.

Because of this I think it might be a carrier problem?  I'm not sure though because there should not be a difference between a camera image file and an image file downloaded from the internet.


Running Android 9 and using the Messages app.  I did try some alternative Texting apps no difference (and that also leads me to believe it;s a carrier thing or a more fundamental issue with android 9)",1,0.6,0.0,notexthere,0.0,14,196,1

I just picked up the Black Shark 3 after being generally disappointed for most of a year with the Razer Phone 2. I got the EU version (I guess?) and have been having general issues with the wireless.

Periodically, almost the entire suite of wireless connectivity just drops. My WearOS watch (Ticwatch Pro 2020) will disconnect, and the custom watchface I use via Watchfaces disappears. Wifi usually keeps working so I may not notice the drop right away, but if I'm on my phone's cellular connection, nothing goes through even though it shows signal and LTE. In my car on my way home from work this morning I was on the phone with my captain, and the bluetooth connection to my car started cutting in and out, to the point that I had to turn bluetooth off to finish the call. There was no issue up to that point, while driving and listening to Audible.

I am suspecting/hoping it was user error in setting the device up. I backed up my RP2 to Google Drive, because I didn't want to lose my apps/data (I was mostly hoping my Swype settings and game logins would transfer over, since Swype died and I'm being a luddite, and the games require the hassle of 'transfer IDs') and have my text messages transfer over easily. I think it also possibly transferred the core device stuff like cellular and bluetooth settings as well, though am not sure.

Turning airplane mode on and off seems to 'reset' things and it'll reconnect to stuff, for a while again at least. I noticed I am somehow still getting at least some push notifications on my watch even though it shows as disconnected. I am a firefighter, on AT&T's Firstnet, so am also not sure if maybe the Firstnet bands might be being finnicky with the BS3.

I also get the ""Xiaomi SIM activation failed"" alert every time I restart the phone, and sometimes after reboot the keyboard doesn't load. 😬 I get the feeling ill need to reflash again, but knowing where I went wrong first would help!

Does each developer include the GApps he/she/they like or is there a standard like maybe Nano or Pico included for every ROM. Also if I would like to flash my own choice of GApps is there a way to remove the included one and flash mine? If so, how?",9,1.0,8.0,"The reason your post was removed is VERY clear.
r/android is not a subreddit for asking questions like yours, it's not a help and support subreddit or one to go to to ask custom ROM questions.
The onus is on you to check these things before you make a post to avoid you being disappointed or having to repost.

You can't remove preinstalled gapps without editing the ROM zip, and I'm unsure that's even possible or if it is, it's complicated.
Something I've never done so I can't say.

Usually as a rule developers use smaller gapps packages to keep the zip files smaller.
It's not being harsh or forcing anything on you the user.
The developer decides what's best for the rom, please respect that.

You do have a choice though.
if the ROM you want to use doesn't have the preinstalled gapps you want, you simply flash the ROM with no gapps and then flash the gapps you want seperately.
This works particularly well with project treble GSIs.. No not all custom roms have pre-installed Gapps like lineage OS doesn't have it. But in the roms description it'll almost always mention if it comes pre-installed it might not always mention what kind of Gapps. Also as far as I know, no u can't delete the pre-installed Gapps package without making changes to the custom roms ZIP file itself. But u can manually uninstall a Google app you don't want from the that pre-installed Gapps package by rooting ur device and using a bloatware remover application.. Developers should not be including Gapps in the first place. It goes against some terms (can't remember which). 

You can ask the dev for a Gapps free version. A long long time ago, I would just flash my own Gapps over top the existing one, not sure if that still works. 

What's wrong with the Gapps that are included? They are all more or less the same apps within, just more or less depending on the package.. Wait, what ROMs include GApps nowadays?

CyanogenMod got a cease & desist letter from Google because of it, that's why they stopped shipping GApps in their builds.. /r/Android is a news sub, not a question/support sub. That's why. Happy Cake Day! Thank you for answering but I think you misunderstood my initial statement. I know not all developers pre install Gapps but I meant those who do, which one do they install or is it different for each developer?
I mean when we install a ROM don't we have a choice between nano/pico ,etc so which ones do the devs install? Is it some standard set like Nano for example or does that too differ from ROM to ROM as the developer wishes? 

So you can't delete pre installed Gapps? That's a bit harsh then because it's the official version of the ROM I'd like to download and it's like forcing it down the throat anyways, thanks again.. The roms that come pre-installed with GAPPS are usually Nano or Pico but there's no real way to know unless they specify it. One dev could decide to use micro another nano and another Pico but they generally stick to those 3 to keep the file size not to big and to ensure the apps don't use too much RAM and have their rom perceived as being slow or choppy. Their r certain devs that implement AROMA installer like TheGalaxyProject Rom it enables you to choose and install different apps and features during the ROM installation with one of those options being asking whether you'd like to install Micro, nano or pico GAPPS along with a lot of other options like what kernel or custom kernel and baseband version to install..

For the past 3 months my cell service has been getting glitchier and glitcher until yesterday when my cell service stopped returning at all.  I have ATT and know where I isually have service, and my family uses ATT too and their service is fine.

 I first noticed the weekend the COVID stuff started getting big, and thought it was just related service interruptions, but weeks went by and didnt improve. I started noticing that my cell service cut out every time I was charging my phone, and the past week or so noticed that the back of my phone would get really warm whenever the cell service cut out. Initially it would work again when I restarted my phone, at least for a few minutes, then the minutes became seconds,  and now there is nothing.  I also noticed that my battery was draining much faster than normal and my phone was even warmer.

I put my sim card in my 9 year old Pantech slide-out-keyboard phone (Almost made me wish we still used them, ha) and the pantech is working fine, making calls and all that.  Without the SIM card, my android's battery was draining normally again, and then later I noticed that it showed full cell signal bars. I was unable to make calls because it did t have a SIM card of course, but Im guessing I had full signal strength for any emergency calls?

If your service still works then your sim card hasn't been hijacked. A sim card swap scam works by porting out your number to another sim card. Your phones service would almost immediately stop working when that happens. 

The two calls and voicemail could easily just be a number spoof. That's someone using an autodialer that disguises the caller ID with a fake number. 

The Microsoft password reset code sounds like someone trying to reset the password but that doesn't necessarily sound phone number related, especially if you got a code sent to your email.

Granted, yes, it's all too convenient to be happeing at the same time but they don't sound directly related..

I would think I would be getting a shitload of calls if it was a robocall kind of thing. And then the password thing. Makes me feel like I'm compromised in some way but can't figure out how or why...

918,Is it normal for my new phone's battery to drain even though I'm not using it?,gxf1h8,2020-06-05 22:55:11,"A few weeks ago I bought a new phone.

The phone is alright and everything is running smoothly. But the only thing that raises my eyebrow is the fact that the battery gets drained even though I'm not using this.

Earlier today my phone was 97%, I went to bed and slept some 8 hours give or take, I checked my phone and it was 92%.

My friend told me that this was normal because even though I'm not using my phone, there are still apps and stuff in the background that are being run still why the phone is not turned off.

Is this true and is this normal behaviour for a new phone?",36,0.79,33.0,"Your phone is basically a little computer. Just like a laptop left running, it's going to drain battery. Also the fact that it's receiving a signal uses up battery.

All battery-powered devices lose charge when left on without being used. Heck even batteries that are not inserted in anything and left on a shelf discharge slowly over time.. Your phone needs to respond to lots of things even if you have it sitting on your bedside table. The radios for your phone service and wifi need to be listening for calls or messages. It needs to check if their are updates for apps. It needs to backup your photos to the cloud, or download music you have asked for. If you have location on it needs to listen for GPS satellites. Finally it has to ready and waiting for you to pick it up and unlock the screen at any instant.

If you truly power off your phone though, the battery can last for months or years without draining.. Yes, this is completely normal.. Your phone will ""poll"" the cell tower even if you're not in a conversation.  Also background apps run as well as the CPU and associated circuitry in the phone.  The transceiver is powered up when the phone is on and GPS will be running unless you have opted to shut it off.. Yep this is normal. My Note 9 from 2018 goes from 100% at night to 82 when I wake up (with AOD On). Uhhh... batteries will literally go empty even when not connected to anything at all. Yes.

If your device was on, that's normal. If it was off, then a 5% drain on a single night is a lot and that's not good.. I *wish* my phone **only** dropped 5% overnight.. Why would this NOT be normal? If you don't want the battery to be used at all turn the phone COMPLETELY OFF. Is this like the first piece of technology you've ever had? lol. I think OP knows it is normal for your phone to drain battery without using it. I think he is more worried about how fast his battery drains, my battery only uses 1 to 3 percent when I go to bed and sleep for 10 hours (From 10PM to 8AM) My phone is turned off, not shutted down.

Although it is normal, I think your phone drains MORE battery than usual, I suggest you turn off all your network connections, close all operating apps and optimize you phone before going to bed.. To some extent it is normal to drain battery when you are not actively using it. 5% over night may be normal, depending on what you have installed on the device. You can always go to battery settings and see an overview of what used power and how much since the last charge. Often its things like Facebook app that drain a shitload of battery for no reason.

If you are not connected to wifi and have somewhat low cell signal, that can also drain battery more than optimal.. It depends on the phone model and OS version. Android 10, for example, on my Pixel 3A won't eat up more than 1%-2% of the battery over night, because it's very efficient & connected to WiFi. Also, there are no apps running while I don't use it except from your regular email polling,etc. Older OS tend to drain more. This and depending on what apps are doing in the background.. It is pretty very normal especially with the percentages to the hours you are talking about. 

The phone always has activities going on at the background that is what keeps the phone alive hence it will drain the battery. 
 
So you have nothing to worry about.. Yep. Yup, idle drain is normal. If you loose like more than 10 percent in the same 8 hour period then you should be looking at the ""why"" matter. 4 to 5 percent during night time is totally normal.. Welcome to ZenFone 5Z, 100%-92% in 4 hours standby after Android 10.. Is this a serious question?. Is this some kind of troll question?. It's completely normal,put it in airplane mode overnight and it will reduce the power consumption. Turn off all GPS, bluetooth, Data, Radio, Wifi, NFC, etc. Turn on airplane mode.

Then put the phone on its power saving mode if it has one.

Then see how much battery it loses overnight.. You're right, but I'd just like to add that it depends on the amount of drain. Going from 97 to 92 is absolutely fine, but dropping to say 77 would not. In that case OP should investigate what's 'using' the phone while on standby.. But isn't more than 2% overnight a lot? My phone drains 1% overnight, sometimes 0, with Wi-Fi on.

Edit: why the downvotes? are you guys jealous that my phone's battery doesn't drain as fast as yours? 

I actually get up to 12 hours of SoT on most days :). Probably more with AOD off. Even if the phone is ""off"", it will use a very small amount of power because the ""power"" button really isn't an on/off switch.  The phone uses a minuscule amount of power to detect the depression of the momentary contact ""power"" switch.. >worried about how fast his battery drains, 

Well yes, that was my biggest concern.

''  I think your phone drains MORE battery than usual, I suggest you turn off all your network connections, close all operating apps and optimize you phone before going to bed.++

I know how to turn off my network connection, but what about the rest? How do I close operating apps and optimize my phone?. It's not. My S7 with replaced battery uses ~%10 overnight sometimes.. Yeah most likely, i use it as a clock though so i wont turn it off.. He’s talking about shutting the phone down. Just close all recent apps. If you have [this](https://imgur.com/a/dnu1vIY) on your phone, I think it's better.. https://amp.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/echo-dot-with-clock-amazon-alexa-alarm-clock-smart-speaker
Echo Dot with Clock: Amazon's cheap Alexa alarm clock .... And so am I.

The way the circuitry works in a phone causes it to consume a *very* small amount of power (even when ""off"") to sense the power button.  That takes a small amount of current.  

The ""power switch"" on a phone is a momentary contact switch that triggers the power up sequence when depressed.  The power switch is not an ""open/close"" (SPST) type of switch like a wall switch or similar which would stop all power consumption.  It's a bit different.

The only way to cease all power consumption by the phone would be to remove the battery but for all practical purposes, the amount of power used to sense the switch is so small it would take a long time before one noticed any power consumption from an ""off"" phone.

For more information, [here's](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/64713/how-do-these-modern-power-buttons-on-devices-work) an article on the subject.. I did all of that.

I literally did everything that I could.

I even went to the store and asked if such a battery drain was normal for this phone and they said yes.. Thanks for the tip man but my phone works fine, plus I already have an Echo 3 and a nest mini in my room so I really don't need another one hahaha",1213.0,16,111,1

I tried the following: soft resets, virus scan, malware scan, deleting unused apps, booting in safe mode, removing the case, and a factory reset. 


The scans found nothing. Deleting apps didn't help. Safe mode was inconclusive since I can't find a reliable way to replicate the problems. Factory reset only got rid of about 25% of the problems.

Lawnchair works on android 10 but you need the android 10 version of lawnchair to use with quickswitch.

Look for the Q pre alpha or Q merge version of lawnchair

it's probably about the best one to use with quickswitch and android 10.. Lawnchair V2 builds with the q-merge label (on apkmirror), OnePlus Launcher, Pixel Launcher (both the standard and a ported Android 11 version), One UI home, most Launcher3 variants like Trebuchet from Lineage OS and there's an alternative to quickswitch called systemless launcher mods that adds another Launcher3 fork called Shady Launcher which is halfway between Trebuchet and the Pixel Launcher (and my personal favourite, still quite barebones and light like the Pixel Launcher, but has icon customisation, ability to hide the Google Search bar and hiding apps from the drawer).

So I have a Samsung S10e running android 10 (oneUI).

Webview is not installed on my phone.
And zygote_secondary is webview?. >webview is not installed

Every phone comes with android system webview, it's a part of the OS. You can see it in the list of installed apps if you toggle showing system apps. The webview can be replaced by Google Chrome webview or an alternative webview, but it still comes included. A webview is necessary to render webpages within apps.

Did you read what the other person said? Zygote launches processes.

Instead of assuming you have a virus for no reason at all you could have googled what these system components do. In fact, you could have Googled what wlan0 and p2p0 is and found the answer right away too.. I know what zygote is.
Zygote_secondary on the otherhand, in Google came up about some exploit in Gmail.
I know what wlan is
I know what p2p.
But the app was saying it is active and wifi direct on phone is turned off.
Swlan I  haven't ever heard of it and really couldn't find anything on it.

My Gmail accounts, FB, dating apps, have all been compromised. Pics on my phone disappear. Files will save to folders I can't see or find,but if I look at my directory from Drive, I can see the folder.
I constantly deactivate Find my phone in Device Admin. And every time I look again, it is back on.
Someone is in my phone.

So. If you know any of the answers, to the specific questions I asked, I would be super appreciative if you could help a brotha out.

951,"Someone called my Mum, and they could see her phone",gx209c,2020-06-05 10:25:36,"My Mum called me to tell me that someone had called her, purporting to be an amazon employee. He said that they had accidentally overcharged her and wanted to refund her the money. She said ok. He then said ""your phone battery is low, could you please plug it in"". Thing is, her phone battery was 2%, so it sounds like he really could see her screen. She plugged her phone in and then he said ""I need your bank details to credit the money back. Could you please log into your bank account on your phone.""
At this point my mum panicked and hung up. He called her back 3 times.

She has an Android Alcatel 3x.",59,0.9,32.0,"FYI: Most phones start vibrating at different intervals when you're having a call at very low battery to make you aware of it.

""purporting to be an amazon employee. He said that they had accidentally overcharged her and wanted to refund her the money""

\- I am pretty sure everything money related (including refunds to funding source or user account) is automated at amazon.

&#x200B;

I am not so sure if a factory reset will be enough, take a look at the keyboards installed. Maybe he could not see the screen but capture input.. Literally impossible if it was a regular phone call. If she installed an app that he told her to, then that would be more likely.

It's more likely that he said ""in case your battery is low"" or something similar because they don't want their victim's phones to die in the middle of stealing their money and your mom's phone just happened to be almost dead.. ""Your phone battery is low, could you please plug it in"" is basically the same as saying ""I see you had someone close to you die"" from a psychic. It either works (which it usually will) or it doesn't. Now if they said ""your phone battery is at 2% you need to plug it in now"", we'll talk. I see this totally as a scam call.. They could've just been lying about the phone battery thing?. >He then said ""your phone battery is low, could you please plug it in"". Thing is, her phone battery was 2%, so it sounds like he really could see her screen.

It was just an educated guess.  In the world of magic it's called ""mentalism"".. On the scam side of this, you can watch the Youtube channel of Jim Browning, he is the knight to end popular scams. 

It is a refund scam, posing as Amazon rep or Microsoft rep etc. As long as you don't give in it's fine. 

Seems your phone is fine. Don't worry.. R/howtohack might be more helpful. Also, if they have screen access, with a bit of simple work they have full access. They've already gotten through basic securities but are willing to do it illegal. Get any bank info off that asap.. Never seen anything like that, but a complete factory reset might be in order.. A factory reset with clear all data is the safest options. I would also look into apps installed on device and check ones with weird permissions. Accessibility services is another thing worth checking as they tend to be granted special permissions to see what's on the screen all the time.. Apps like anydesk etc which can control your phone or view it over network are often used by scammers. See if there is such app and uninstall it. And I am really happy that your mom realised that it was a scam.. I really wouldn't worry about it. Like others commented, the scammer was just guessing, that's what they do. Low battery is pretty common depending on time of the day, and basically everybody with a cellphone has their bank's app installed.  
Props to your mom for catching up with this guy's fishy-ness!!. Scan with malwarebytes or whatever you use,then  Do a proper wipe anyway just to be safe but its likely they were just using a tactic. Also, as far as I am aware (as someone who has had issues with amazon previously requiring them to contact me) amazon will NOT call you unless you specifically requested a call back when trying to fix something with customer service. Nor will they ask for your banking info. They already have it, why would they need you to say it over the phone? They don't. When my moms card got compromised (gas station attendant copied the number and tried to use it on amazon) I contacted them and got it sorted very quickly. The only thing I needed to verify regarding her bank account/cc was the last 4 digits and when the last time the card had been used on amazon was.

 This was a scam for sure. Really glad your mom figured that out before any damage besides anxiety could take place. You should also report the phone number used to amazon.. She's on a  scam list, it will never end,   change her phone number and make sure it's a fresh number , tell her not give it out to websites or marketing  premoations, they can't see the phone , unless she let them install something, they use cold reading techniques , to scam people as well , utter gutter trash, if want to understand what's going on, look up social engineering. Its a sales tool. He says that hoping you listen. If you say yes, he knows he has you and you will say yes you mor3 things.. What apps does she have on her phone?  Most likely the person was just saying something to make her think that she could trust him.

We want to make sure there's nothing on the phone that is untoward.. Possible heard the vibartioms or the sound of low battery, or they jsit want you to plug it in to make sure you don't disconnect.. First of all, huge props to your mom for realizing this was fishy and hanging up.

As for remote screen access, there are many legitimate apps that can provide such access. Team Viewer, Splashtop, just to name a few. Even ""scrcpy"". There is no way for us to tell what she could possibly have installed. But in either case, someone must have installed those. Maybe a family member did this for remote support at some point in the past, but then their remote support account got hacked?

Also, could be your mom was in a public space, and someone was using binoculars to view her phone screen from a distance while she spoke on speaker or earphones.. Don't install third party apps. It can be infected with malware.. This sounds like a classic scammer. You tuber Kitboga pranks them all the time. They prey on elderly people, gain access to their bank account, “send” them refunds ( actually they transfer money from one of the persons other accounts) and “accidentally” overpay, then requesting the person to send the extra back.
  
  They don’t actually have access to the phone, it’s probably that they’re just guessing about the battery or picking up on some noise.. Pick anybody on the planet around 8 pm and you're likely to find a low battery.. /r/howtohack. Actually, just turning off any WiFo on the phone should be fine, no?

Maybe they is a hack with the sim card but ... r/foundthemobileuser. Every app outside of playstore is considered a third party app right? I install third party apps but only from trusted sources with good audience scores. Yup, they could've just taken a shot in the dark and it landed. The phone probably has a data connection.

I'm interested in rooting a Cubot King Kong 3 phone (MT 6763 phone), which features Oreo 8.1.

For   my general understanding, I have a few questions and I really that   somebody is so kind to help me shed some light on the following:

1. Is   it possible to root any random phone just by unlocking the bootloader   with ADB, flashing TWRP and then installing SuperSU in the recovery?

Is   this the general approach I can use also on the Cubot King Kong 3? Or   do I need a TWRP which is modified / customized for this phone? I would   like to clarify this, before I do something and brick the phone.

2.   What are some safety measures to take, before trying to root, so that I   can reinstate the phone to the original state, if something goes  wrong?

3.  Do I have to disable  any kind of data partition encryption so that I  can root the phone? Or  can I still root the phone without doing this?

4.   What is a scatter file and for what is it used? I've read a lot of   guides and it seems to be used only with SPFlash. Does this mean, that I   do not need this, if root by going the ADB+TWRP+SuperSU route?

5. If after unlocking the bootloader with fastboot, I am getting the message  ""*Orange State Your devices has been unlocked* and *can't* be *trusted*. "" at boot, then what went wrong and can this be fixed?

6.   If after flashing the stock ROM, which Cubot provides on their forum, I   get a red text ""Not Verify"" in the upper right corner of the screen   every time the phone is on, then what went wrong and can this be fixed?

Even though I have rooting experience on a number of devices, I cannot comment on yours because Chinese devices are a completely different matter and what works on a usual device is very different on a Chinese device.
Those warning messages should be safely ignored and can be removed on most bootloader unlocked devices, but I have no idea how to do that on a cubot.

I suggest visiting XDA and search the forums for your particular device, that's the only place I can suggest.
If XDA has nothing, no one else will apart from a device spefic website.. I see. XDA was the first site where I checked. They don't have any rooting guides or custom ROMs for this phone.... If XDA doesn't have it... It probably doesn't exist. Not saying it doesn't, but those folks do it all.",191.0,11,327,1

You need a higher android version (9+) to do this.

You can look at custom launchers like nova / Hyperion / lawnchair that can darken the navbar and a custom lockscreen like floatify or Ava, and custom notification shades like one shade and power shade that you can give a dark theme, power is pixel themed, and one is Samsung one UI themed.

Also I was going to suggest looking at custom ROMs but the J7 crown looks to be a carrier locked device so you would not be able to unlock it's bootloader to do anything like that.. Well that sucks lol was hoping I could do something with it.. You got a min to chat? Have a cpl other questions for ya. Yeah well that rly sucks!

Like lollipop or marshmallow? Or is there anyway to root my phone? Again thanks for the help!. Custom ROMs are aftermarket firmwares for supported phones and Samsungs are very well supported - if your device can been bootloader unlocked.
So in effect, you can flash any android version from Oreo (what you have now) to pie (android 9) or android 10 (the current latest android version)
Lollipop (android 5.1) and marshmallow (android 6) are much older versions that you can't flash to your device - you cannot flash an older version than you already have - downgrading is possible but technically challenging and complicated. Forget that.

Some US carriers make their devices unlockable, you buy the phone direct from the carrier much cheaper but give up any further future customisation because they lock down the device bootloader.
There's no workaround or hacks for these devices.

If you can't unlock the bootloader, it's impossible to root or flash custom ROMs unfortunately.",387.0,4,104,1

970,Question about passwords and how apps handle them.,gwu0bl,2020-06-05 00:31:36,"So I've been downloading a bunch of apps lately, lots of which require you to log in. Problem is, some of these apps, which are actually apps from large legitimate companies, when I type my password in, gboard will show the password at the top in the autocomplete suggestions in plain view as I type it for the first time. It then remembers my password, and whenever I type the first 2 or 3 letters, the password appears again for me to tap to auto fill it in. I could be typing anywhere, in any app, on any website, even in this reddit text box im typing in now, and if a word matches the first 2 or 3 letters, gboard shows my password again, plainly visible to anyone that can see my screen. As gboard is treating it as a normal learned word rather than a password, it's probably also storing it in plain text somewhere, rather than encrypting it like a password should be, and possibly exposing it to other apps. 

So, correct me if I'm wrong, but the developers of the apps that I'm typing my password in to (not the gboard app) should somehow be preventing this, right? Are they not properly coding their password box as a password or something? I could have sworn that other apps are somehow temporarily able to disable gboard's autocomplete while I'm typing a password. 

I sent feedback on one of the apps to the company and they just told me to turn off my autocomplete. I stopped using that app and cut ties with them because they obviously don't value password security.",1,0.6,1.0,"As far as I know, yes the devs of the apps should be coding the box as password boxes so that the keyboards detect it as such. One way to check if it's an issue with the devs of the app or a bug on the keyboard, try another keyboard and see if it still remembers. 

One way that's easy and you don't have to type anything is Swiftkey. Just slap a bright colored theme on Swiftkey, then tap the password box. If the theme stays, then it's not coded as a password box. If the theme disappears and you are shown a sort of ""incognito"" dark gray theme with the top options bar missing, it's detected as a password box.

First I thought it was the headphones then I bought 3 new headphones to replace them and for backups - I bought new headphones and tried them all and they all had the same static in the right headphone - the static is low and gives off a buzz feeling as in you can slightly feel the static of it as well like a very light vibration - when I click pause to pause audio the headphone audio pauses and the static carries on buzzing for a second then cuts off where you can hear the cut off and then the static stops - then press play and the static starts again with the audio - so when the audio is paused the electric stops going through it and stops causing the buzz.

So I bought a few 3.5mm male to female jacks to try out and found when the 4th pole that controls the mic and play/pause button is not plugged in the sound is perfect with no static but then you lose play/pause functionality and also this is not practical/sustainable to use with the last pole balancing in the port - then I tried old type 3 pole headphones into the 3.5mm jacks and they work perfect with no static but also no play/pause functionality on those type of headphones - also tried headset type (over-head type) headphones and they worked with no static.

So I have narrowed it down to the problem being the 4th pole that controls mic and play/pause functionality - I also tried the headphones in other devices and they work normal so it is definitely the phone that has had some type of damage that now causes static through the headphones.

Now I am going to disassemble the phone to see if anything is touching the headphone port or something I don't know what is wrong with it or what I should do though so does anybody know where to start.

And locate internal storage of. Your device
And Open Android folder in it
There you will see a folder named as 'obb'
Check that folder you may have not deleted the game data.. Try the sd maid app.  It can usually find some stuff left behind by uninstalled apps and remove it.. First thing you should know is generally speaking, cleaner apps, antivirus, ram boosters/managers/etc and the like are garbage you want to stay well away from. They screw up your device and mess with the way your device normally handles itself, and they generally require far too many permissions that are a bit invasive. Many of these types of apps - notably, anything by cheetah mobile, which iirc was finally kicked out of the play store - are not built for your benefit, but to make the dev money through pushy ads or outright stealing your info.

That said, files by google (formerly files go) is a really good app. There is a cleaner function that's built in, but it doesn't mess with your device the way most other apps do, and gives you more control over what it ""cleans"". There's also an airdrop-like sharing feature built in, which is really nice, if a bit slow at times. You can use this app to clear up some of your storage space.

Second thing you should consider is that you didn't actually uninstall the apps, or they're maliciously hiding themselves. You should never install from any source besides the official play store, f droid (open source repository with a good reputation), or apkmirror (run by the Android police folks and they're professionals with standards). Go to your device settings, then apps, then select show all apps, hunt through there and uninstall anything you downloaded but thought you got rid of. There will be plenty of things you can't uninstall that are part of the OS, and depending on your device, ROM, etc, a bunch of apps you don't need/want, but still can't get rid of anyway (that's why I only buy pixel devices: they're stock Android without bloatware).

Also, as an aside, you should be using google photos and disabling your other gallery app, if you have one. That'll allow you to back up your photos to your google account, and in the app you won't notice the difference between ones on your device vs only in the cloud. You can gain some storage there too by deleting photos from your device. (But ONLY your device! Careful not to delete the cloud copy!)

...that was a lot longer than I intended, but Happy Deleting anyway, I guess?. At least on desktop, MEGA uses browser cache for downloads. So if you used your browser to download, check how much storage space your browser uses, and clean data/cache as needed. I've never used the MEGA app on Android so I don't know how exactly it works but if you did, check that instead of your browser. Normally the path is Settings > Apps & Notifications > [App Name] > Storage.. If you have a Samsung, go into files and click the 3 dot button. Click on recycle bin. Then delete everything in there. SD maid. It's great at finding app leftovers. Gram this and do a scan, it will show you where your space is being used

https://youtu.be/tUX-frlNBJY. if you want a very clean storage and better UX I would recommend you look into rooting and custom roms. There are apps like SD Maid Pro which I absolutely love. I have cleaned more than 15GB of junk files with that app, absolutely love it. With the Pro version I bought I can schedule it to clean itsself once a week while I'm sleeping. (If you are willing to root and buy this app, the Pro version is much better). For a better user experience and fluidity I use Adaway, just blocks adds. Although I do keep ads on for free apps since devs need to eat too. For battery saving apps I use NapTime, Servicely and FrancoKernelManager, all are amazing and all require root access. As for your question, what I would regularly do when I wasn't rooted was do a factory reset every 6 months. This gave me peace of mind that all my files were clean and all supposed viruses were removed. As for apps which don't require root acess and clean files, I have never had one work for me. Tbh they all seem like a fancy animation to me and that's it. If you actually wanna clean, use the cleaner in your settings, I fnd that the most effective, but yet again, not all phones have that feature built in. I hope my comment helped you and others!

Edit: Forgot to mention there is an option in the Play Store where you can mass delete all apps you want. Google Play Store > threee lines in the top left corner > My apps and games > Installed > Storage and there you can uninstall any apps you want without the annoying pop up you get when manually uninstalling apps. Also, I agree with u/mrandr01d comment a lot. Very great points!. I've never checked there haha.
Thanks for the great idea mate, helps out a lot.. Update : Still clean, there are no deleted game data on the obb.. Update : It says that I used 26GB out of (~~ I forgot)
and I have 3.3 GB left. I cleaned it and turns out my big file are just my video which is only 1GB and the other files are KB.

Is there something wrong with my phone?. Yes!
This was the kind of app that I was trying to download but didn't knew the name of.

Thanks, helps out a lot!. Wow, this really helps out.

I've always wondered about these cleaner apps.
Somehow I always have 1GB+ worth of cache. Everytime I want to ""boost"" my phone speed it shows it disabling apps I'm not even using or have ever opened.

Secondly, I think this was a lesson for my my mistake.
I was too carefree when it comes to downloading apps from the internet. I think both when I'm unistalling or deleting the original file to install from it adds to my internal storage.

Lastly, If I should avoid any kind of gallery app other than google photos.. Should I avoid the default gallery samsung provided?

Again, Thanks kind person from the internet.
Will try these tips ASAP.. Ok I will try to do it, Thanks this really helps out a lot.. Update : I checked my browser and MEGA storage usage. And both those app didn't really used that much or have that much cache.

Just the normal amount, same as the other 96 apps on my phone. They don't use that much.

I guess I'm just confused where all this thrash came from.. I use samsung, but when i go to my files and click the 3 dot button it doesnt have recycle bin option, only settings and storage analysis. I didn't even knew that existed, Thank you will try this later.. Update : I have samsung
I go to files
I click three dots
No recycle bin

Is ""My Files"" not the default app or am I using the wrong app?. Ok thanks mate, hope you have a great day!. Hey, can you elaborate what you mean?
The link goes to a video about election. What does gram means?

Thanks. Unless you have a backup device to learn on, or a really good understanding of what root is and how it can be used against you, I'd strongly disrecommend that. OP said they're not that techy.

You obviously didn't read my post that carefully or misunderstood what I said since I said those apps (naptime, sd maid, etc) are all things you should stay away from.. Probably not, you just need to find whatever is using up that space.

If you go into Settings and find storage settings, does it show you % of where your files are? For example, here is what my Pixel shows me: [https://i.imgur.com/ajTvd1I.png](https://i.imgur.com/ajTvd1I.png) Then if I tap one of those categories, it shows me which apps in those categories are using the space.. >Lastly, If I should avoid any kind of gallery app other than google photos.. Should I avoid the default gallery samsung provided?

I didn't mean to say that built in gallery apps are bad because they're malicious or anything, it's just that I think they're clutter. In the pre-GPhotos days, that was just how you managed your pictures, and you were left SOL for a backup solution you didn't piece together (and maybe even pay for) yourself. Now GPhotos is very capable of managing all that, so you can have your cake and eat it too, all in one app. No point (especially for someone's who's not as interested in tech) in dealing with a second, less capable app that might even incidentally screw up your photo roll, imo.. Idk why though, i use one ui 2 so..... You too!. Oops, posted the wrong link

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.diskusage. hilarious. Why should you stay away from Naptime and SD Maid, huh, what s your argument, why should you stay away from them? It seems to me you may have just spoken out of no experience whatsoever. Yes I understand OP isn t that tech savy, but no one is at the beginning. Just saying that things are bad without any experience or proof whatsoever is stupid on its own. I expect you to either back up your statement with facts or just then seek attention elsewhere.

Also I understand free non root apps are really bad, and mess with your device but they honestly can t mess it up THAT much. Without root access most exploits are used by third party apps and not by apps from the play store. I despise all battery and storage optimisers besides the ones I mentioned in my comment above. I have more than 4  years of experience with rooting and almost 9 years of experience with android. I have tried a lot of stupid stuff and I have a pretty good general ideea of which apps are bad an which are not so. I also recommend apps from which are open source but a lot of them aren't so there s not much you can do about that. If you bring me solid proof of those solid apps ""fucking up"" your device or being malicious I will apologise, but I honestly don't think that's the case right now.. There are 7GB in package installer (°0°)
And 1.somthing GB in Google play services.

I now have a brand new LG v60 and the problem persists. I notice it on my Bluetooth speaker, Bluetooth car radio and even on my headphones which are wired. Obviously there is no issue with this phones RAM or storage. 

I've scoured the web for answers but keep coming up with the same ""solutions"" that don't apply, so I thought i would ask here.

Again, its totally random. Sometimes more frequent and others less so. And it only happens between songs. So a song will finish, but the next won't start until I press play again.

I only use my phones music player, I don't stream. So the songs are on the phone itself, and not on an SD card.

985,makes my phone think 4g is wifi?,gwpbnj,2020-06-04 20:19:44,"so games can tell if its 4g or wifi and for some reason i got a game which just cant download updates if its on 4g (honkai impact),tried everything and i cant fix it so is there any way to make it think its wifi?",1,1.0,9.0,"If it's downloading from the Play Store, open the Play Store app and in the menu choose Settings. There are two settings that you will want to look at and possibly change:

* App download preference
* Auto-update apps

These should be ""Over any network"" in order to download over 4g.. its in-app. However, if the app doesn't have a place to specify whether to use 4g or not, that's where you would set it. (Apps are supposed to honor that.)

If you downloaded the app from the Play Store, that's where it gets its updates too.

Not all devices have a way to set this in the device settings. I don't have any that *don't* use the Play Store so I don't know if there's a way to change this setting on other devices.. there are updates which are downloaded in-game instead of in the playstore and its not about telling it to use 4g or wifi.  
most of my week im not at home so im useing 4g and for some reason the in-game updates wont update on 4g(tried going to the games support,they arent helpful).   
the thing is that if i use someone elses phone (it was even from the same network provider) and turn it to wifi hotspot,its all good and download propoley.. Yes, it downloads in the game, but it still downloads from the Play Store. That's a strict requirement in order for them to distribute the game through the Play Store. They can't sideload updates, because then someone could create a safe app but then sideload something malicious later.

When you use someone's hotspot, *your* phone assumes it's connected to WiFi. It has no idea about the upstream connection.

Just go change that setting in the Play Store and then try it again, instead of arguing.. tried it,still didnt work.. App download preference is over any network and auto update is turned off.  
Theres no update in the game right now (uselly theres at least 2 every week) so i will tell you the results then. Well that sucks. I'd say this is on the game developer at this point, since that setting is what they're supposed to use.. well,back to nagging the cs...thanks anyways",368.0,7,45,1

17,My speaker doesn’t work anymore !!,hc4kid,2020-06-19 17:10:48,"I was listening to music, casually, volume all the way up, then suddenly the volume drops down and sounds kinda muffled, when I got to the phone, I noticed that the bottom speaker doesn’t work anymore, the sound only comes out of the earpiece, I have an iPhone 8.

Here are the things I tried: blowing air into the speaker, shaking it a little bit (It may be dumb but you never know), [apple’s recommendations](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203794), water eject although it hadn’t been anywhere near water (that reminds me I had resorted to this around 2 months ago, some water had gotten into one of the speakers, or maybe both, but I eventually got it out (which again reminds me, I think around that same time I experienced something similar, only then I was on Instagram, got the phone to my ear to listen to an audio, and it was stuck on outputting from the earpiece, it worked fine after a simple reboot) I don’t know if any of this is relevant), making a call on speaker works but only through the top speaker, plugging and unplugging headphones, on and off Bluetooth, rebooting, reset settings, and only then did I remember hard reboot was an option, and since it still didn’t work, I tried it too. Finally I tried cleaning up the lightning port and the speaker grill with a sharpened q-tip, although there wasn’t much to clean.

I think the next step is to factory reset, but I’d like to see if there’s anything else I can do.

I saw a video somewhere where they had a similar issue and fixed it by deleting an app that “controls the speakers”, I haven’t installed any new app, is there a way to see which apps do that?, but I guess if that was the case resetting settings should’ve solved it?

Could you help me figure out what could’ve happened? I didn’t really drop it that day (yesterday, this happened ~18h ago), didn’t get no shock or any particular damage. It just happened out of nowhere. Could it be that something disconnected? How? Why? Or maybe the speaker is just dead and needs to be replaced ?

Apple has to have some feature for it, I mean I have my apple id password and even know the passcode! What more do they want to verify that it was my phone? 😖. That would enable them to reset your device.  They’ll never do data recovery.

Why didn’t you have these ‘very important’ photos backed up?

What if it had been stolen rather than disabled?. If this were possible you could steal a phone and get the data off it.   Which would t be good, right?. That was very stupid of me! I should've had done a backup but I am so f-in careless! 😐️ 
My ipod was stolen too and I hadn't backed up its data also. However I didn't learn anything from that experience 🤦‍♂️ I couldn't care less at that time.

Apple has (deliberately) made it hard/impossible to retrieve data without the cooperation of the installed/authorised iOS.. Likely not, but worth a try.. Just saying the phone is fried everything is gone. The data is like irretrievable, the hardware probably isn’t ‘fried’ though.

OP needs to learn how to make and maintain backups.. I been through this for years. Once the device runs out of storage you have to erase the device. Everything is gone . You can try soldering people but can’t find anyone. Sigh... that’s not ‘fried’.

Fried is hardware failure, to the point of being bricked.

39,Deleted video keeps coming back and multiplying,hbdsor,2020-06-18 12:37:14,"6S. I have a video I uploaded from my dash cam to the photos album. I deleted the video and every few days it reappears in my photos album. There are usually 3-10 copies that appear each time and it’s a 15 minute video. I’ve tried turning off cloud, turned off everything possible with photos. There’s probably 30 copies of the video in my album every week.",3,0.81,5.0,"I’m not sure but possibly iCloud photos???. How did you transfer the video from your dash cam to your iPhone initially?

&nbsp;

If there is a wired (or wireless) connection between your phone and the camera, and the video is still stored locally on your dash cam, it’s conceivable that’s how the video reappears.

&nbsp;

In addition, if there is a cloud service to which your cam connects, such as Dropbox, it may have read/write access to your photos on iOS. I am unsure if cloud services (other than iCloud) currently have the ability to push photos and videos to your iOS Photos Camera Roll, but it’s worth mentioning.. It’s turned off and I even cleared iCloud of everything except contacts.. I used a memory card adapter to plug the memory card into my phone. Then used the “files” app to download the video to my Photos app.. Doesn’t sound like that would be the culprit, then. If you turned off all the iCloud syncing options except for contacts as you stated, including iCloud Drive, it’s possible the video gets transferred back if you sync your phone to iTunes or the Mac Photos app via cable or Wi-Fi somehow. That assumes the video is on your other device and it detects the video is “missing” on your phone, resulting in its restoration.

&nbsp;

Apple Support could probably help you if none of that seems likely, since they’re the experts. You can call them on the phone or use a form on the Apple website and someone will email you back with a reply. For this, I’d suggest a phone call.",264.0,7,67,0

Soak it with water and then squeeze most of the water out but allow some to remain inside. Maybe squeeze out 75% of the water.

With the iPhone oriented sideways so that the side button is on top, press the button repeatedly through the paper towel while allowing water to squeeze out to wash out the button area. This should be far safer than just putting the button under running water or putting the button just barely under standing water and pressing it.

iPhone 7 is the first iPhone to have water resistance, so this should be safe. However, it's your choice whether you do this, so if any water damage occurs, I will not be held responsible. I'm just telling you what you can do because I believe there's no other way unless you want to take it to an Apple store and have them clean it. That could be expensive.

I have iPhone 11 and I did this successfully. I accidentally got a little lemonade splashed onto my side button which later resulted in the clicky feeling being completely eliminated. After doing what I described above, it feels and operates just like new and it has felt and operated just like new ever since.

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**
So im in a semi long distance relationship, 2 hours away, and my significant other and I enjoy video chatting each other when im not close by. She has an Android Samsung Galaxy S10. When we first started video chatting, I had an Iphone X and we used Whatsapp messenger for our video calls. We had ZERO issues when it came to her hearing me and I hearing her. Sometimes I would just regular facetime her work phone which is an iPHone X as well, and everything worked.

My Iphone X shit the bed, and I had to upgrade. I got an Iphone 11 pro. Since day ONE, facebook messenger, facetime app, and whatsapp ALL have ""hearing"" issues. What I mean by this is, the video works fine on both wifi and cellular data. However, 75% of the time, she only hears every other word or sometimes even every 4th or 5th word. Its bad. To the point that we dont video chat much anymore because theres no point due to she cant get what im saying.

On my current phone, when I look at the message it was sent to me on, the file appears but it can’t be interacted with.

54,What's the appeal of wireless charging for iPhones?,hau790,2020-06-17 16:09:59,"I have an iPhone XS and I recently picked up an Anker Powerwave pad to try out wireless charging.  So far, I'm not sure I totally understand the appeal of it.

Wireless charging:
- is slower than a high amperage lightning connection (USB Power Delivery)
- requires a more precise positioning than a wired connection (several times I've woken up in the morning with an uncharged phone, having accidentally nudged it off the pad in my sleep)
- prevents the use of other useful rear-mounted phone accessories like magnet car mounts and Pop Sockets
- doesn't continue to charge while you are using the phone (since you've lifted it up from the charging pad)

The only upsides that I can see is that you reduce the daily wear & tear on the lighting port, and that placing it on a pad is somewhat faster and more convenient than reaching for a cable and plugging it in.

I'd love to embrace a wonderful future without wires, but I don't really see the upsides right now.  Am I missing something?",13,0.94,14.0,"It’s convenient to charge the device overnight by throwing it into your wireless charging pad, without the need to fiddle about with cables. 

It’s true that it prevents use of accessories that clamp into the back, but for those of us that don’t like those accessories this is a non-issue. 

Also you can get chargers with different angles so you can use the device while it’s charging.. My use case: when I’m at work I can toss it down on my desk on a charging pad, and when I get called somewhere I can just grab and go. I can keep the cable going to the pad tucked away to help keep my desk a little more tidy.. I find the fact that you can’t use it an advantage cause it stops me scrolling through reddit when I get into bed and I usually sleep better when that happens. Plugging requires fine motor skill.  When you’re tired you have zero motivation to put in the effort to wake up your brain to put in the work to apply fine motor skills.  Solution is the wireless charging pad.  Zzzzzzzzz. I have three in my room, I can just drop my phone on one to charge, pick it up easily, no cables to deal with, especially in the dark, I just drop it on the pad, a weird hand motion to align it if I'm not looking and boom.

It's a really subjective thing. Some like me, think it's the coolest thing but a lot of people don't really care.. I use Samsung Wireless Charger, with a fast charge option to charge my iPhone XS Max. So far, so good. And it's pretty fast, much quicker than lightning cable port. It's convenient for use, I just put my phone and go to sleep.   


As far as a battery health concerns, I think It doesn't affect it that much.. I have a car mount that is also a wireless charger. That’s pretty cool.. Samsung, Anker, and MyCharge produce portable wireless chargers (they are portable charging banks that double as a wireless charger) which allows you to use your phone while it's wireless charging. I use a [myCharge 10,000 mAh](https://www.amazon.com/myCharge-Wireless-Portable-10000mAh-Certified/dp/B07CP3JSKL/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=mycharge+portable+wireless+charger&qid=1592424310&sr=8-3) whenever I was traveling and at an airport since it allowed me to play on my phone, text, and make calls while it was charging.. I have a wireless charging stand. I keep my phone on it while working. That way it’s keeping a charge but I don’t have to mess with wires when I get a text or want to check something on it. I wouldn’t use it as the only charger myself though.. My last two iPhones have had their USB ports die on me and I could no longer charge them. That’s why I went for one with wireless charging.. I've only used the cradle kind of wireless charger, I have two generic Target store brand chargers (they were on clearance). It works really well with the that style of charger, easy to set it down in the right position. and phone is upright, easy to pick up.  Maybe try the cradle type of design.

I was skeptical of the wireless charging, but kind of wish all my electronics had it now. I still use the lightning cable to charge it when wireless isn't convenient.. Slower the charge, prelong your battery health. Good idea use wireless bedtime and cable during day.. I don't know, it's just cooler to put your phone on a wireless charging pad. Also more convenient.. Maybe it's the type of pad I'm using, but I find that I need WAY MORE motor finesse with the pad. I can plug a lighting cable into my phone in the dark, with my eyes closed.

With the pad, I have to make sure the phone is properly centred, that the LED on the pad turns on (to indicate the connection is good) and/or to feel the brief vibration from the phone telling me that power is connected.

There’s an option to remotely delete the phone to factory settings. Also an option to track it and make it sound an alarm when turned on when found.. > I did call my provider to block the device but I forgot to ask if the data within will still be accessible.

Welp, this may have wrecked your chances for deleting your data.

[Try going here](https://www.icloud.com/find). Login with your Apple ID, and see if the site can track the location of your phone.  If you're lucky, you might even be able to find out where it is and recover it!

Unfortunately, this requires that your phone be on and have a data connection. If you called your provider and had them block the phone, then it's no longer on the cellular network and won't get data that way.. Only if the phone has auto-connected to WiFi (or the person taking it has connected to a WiFi network or inserted a new SIM) will it show up here.

That site also gives you the option to wipe your phone remotely, but this also requires an active network connection.  Note that if you wipe the data from your phone remotely, you will no longer be able to track its location.

Next time you lose your phone, follow steps in this order:

* Login, track your phone, lock it down with a passcode and a ""contact me"" message
* If you can't locate or physically recover it, *then* do a remote data wipe
* *Then* contact your provider to block the device.

Note: If you had a passcode on your iPhone, then the data on it is encrypted. Whoever has your phone would need the passcode to unlock your device and get data off it.. So when i press on the “erase device” button then it may or may not delete the content depending on if the person who took it connects to the internet. But if i do erase the device will it also delete all my icloud data as well from my other devices?. Thank you all for the help and also helping me not to freak out as much. Already got a new one because of the insurance i had on it. i was only worried about my data being misused.. If the phone is connected to the internet, it will receive the remote erase command and everything will be deleted from the phone.  This will NOT erase any of your data from iCloud or other devices using the same Apple ID.

Did you have the phone set to require a passcode (or Touch/Face ID) to unlock the phone screen?  If you did, nobody else will be able to access the data on your phone unless they know your unlock passcode.. Yes i did have passcode and Face ID but I am worried that there may be a way to bypass all of them and still get into the phone.. They only way to access the phone without the passcode is to put it in recovery mode and restore to factory settings using a computer.  That, of course, will delete everything from the phone including any of your personal data.. There is no way to do that chances are it will be parted out",550.0,16,57,0

It is more likely that the battery needs to be replaced.

There is a PC application called 3utools which you can use to see how many cycles the battery has been through. iPhone batteries last about 500 cycles (One charge cycle is the battery discharge from 100% to 0%), so if your phone is showing 400+ cycles, then it is worth considering replacing the battery. 

FYI - If you discharge the battery to 50% and charge it up. Discharge it to 50% and charge it up, then that is one charge cycle.

As the battery ages from time and discharge cycles, it will become less efficient. By about 500 cycles, the battery would show approximately 80% capacity. For example - a new iPhone 6 capacity is 1810mAh, after 500 cycles, it would have about 1448mAh (80%). This will show up as ""100%"".

However, this may not diagnose any other faults or issues with the device.. I agree that the battery likely needs to be replaced if the issue continues using an Apple-certified charging cable.. I bought it 2 years ago and it has not suffered from either of those. Yeah it prob has something to do with the battery and ill def check out that website tysm",216.0,6,130,0

If your carrier supports VoLTE,you'll see these options: Off, Voice & Data,  Data Only.  Select Data Only.. Is there a certain way to do that or just be connected to wifi?

Nothing works. 

I'm just realizing this because I made a call today and didn't have my Airpods in and noticed that I couldn't hear who I was talking to unless the phone was on speaker.",1,1.0,9.0,"Simple stuff check:

Did you try turning the volume up while on the call?
Does this happen only on phone calls? Do you have the same behavior during FaceTime audio calls or Facebook Messenger audio calls?

Deeper stuff check:

Are you up to date with iOS 13.5.1? Have you tried restarting your iPhone?

Are your other notification sounds playing normally?

Is the sound issue only while your iPhone is directly against your head? If you pull your iPhone away from your head (to the point the display comes back on) does the volume increase?

Trying to help narrow down the issue as the wait time for Apple Support (in the Americas) is running about 30 minutes at this time.. I made sure the volume was all the way up on a call. I just tried FaceTime audio call and it was low as well. I tried pulling my phone away from my face and nothing. 

I have restart my phone, I have reset it. All notifications work. I am up to date on 13.5.1.. When you say that you reset it...did you Erase All Content and Settings or just Reset All Settings?

This is a little bit of a long shot:

Turn off Attention Aware. Attention Aware will adjust volumes based on if the iPhone detects if you are actively using it or not. It should only adjust ringer and notification volumes, but it may be interfering with your call volume as well.

You go into Settings > Accessibility > Face ID & Attention > Attention Aware Features.. I did reset all settings. And I just turned off the attention aware features, no change.. Might want to reach out to Apple Support then. Let them know what you’ve already tried and they will let you know what to do from there.

Just be forewarned, as I mentioned before, wait times have been between 20-30 minutes. Also, if you do need to have your iPhone serviced, the options are limited right now, but they will let you know what is available.

Also, don’t try walking in to an Apple Store as they will turn you away. They are by appointment only for service issues right now.. Okay, I’ll contact them. I was thinking of going to the Verizon store that I bought it from... should I not do that?. They will probably refer you back to Apple since it may be a warranty issue..

**1. iPhone model and iOS version**

*iPhone 8 Plus running 13.5.1*

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

2 years ago, US, AT&T store. Currently on a monthly family plan with AT&T. Other 2 iPhones (X, and 7 Plus) have no issues.

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

iMessage not working. Gets activation unsuccessful. 

**4. What caused the issue?**

This is my daughter's phone so it's hard to know for sure when it started or why.. She mentioned continuously getting prompted for iCloud password and also that it wasn't working (but not sure she knows it for sure). She also mentioned something about a number she didn't recognize when she tried to reset her password for iCloud.

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

I have tried pretty much everything I found on the internet..

* Reset Network Settings
* Reboot iPhone
* Disabled iMessage, FaceTime, signed out of iCloud, waited over night, signed in to iCloud, tried to activate iMessage and it failed.
* Erased phone and restored from backup
* Tried just on LTE, just on WIFI
* Reseated the SIM card

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

What's weird is when you go into Settings > Messages and you hit the ""Send & Receive"" under iMessage.. On mine it shows my apple id at the top, grayed out, then under ""You can receive imessages to and reply from"" it has my phone number (grayed out), my icloud account, and my gmail account.. It has a check mark by all of them

On hers, under the you can receive she has her phone number and her [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) account.. Only the icloud account has a checkmark.. When you try to select her phone number it spins for about 3 seconds and then nothing happens..  No checkmark.. 

Not sure what else to try..

Thanks",3,1.0,3.0,"[deleted]. Make sure if she has any other phone with that number that find my iPhone is turned off. Also sounds like her iCloud was hacked, and that’s a very important account for a couple reasons. Call Apple support and make sure you have proof of purchase and maybe some old emails from Apple if her iCloud really was hacked. Good luck to you! Update us if you happen to resolve this please, it helps make the forum more useful and it’s cool to learn how. In order for iMessage to activate for the telephone number, a silent SMS has to be sent through the carrier.  To test that functionality, go to Settings > Messages, turn iMessage off.   Then, open the Messages app and try sending a text to her own number.  You need to be sure it shows twice (sent & received).

If that is successful, contact Apple Support.  They can check to see if her telephone number has an iMessage or FaceTime block.  That can happen sometimes if someone reports a message as being spam, for example.",184.0,6,308,0

2. I think I purchased the phone in February 2018 so warranty is long gone.

3. So today at the pool I was taking pictures of my boyfriend and baby in the water and I got it wet briefly. I didn’t really think of it as a big deal because I’ve definitely had it in the water the first summer I had it and taken pictures. But then all of a sudden the screen turned off. I didn’t think much about it because the apple comes up on the screen. 

So when we get inside from the pool the screen has the apple comes up and will go back off & then I got the support.apple.com/iPhone/restore screen. I hard restarted it & it came up again, but then when I plug it into my laptop iTunes doesn’t recognize it as being plugged in so I can’t restore it. I just went ahead and ordered a new phone to be picked up tomorrow because my phone is critical for work. I’m guessing that my X is completely toast & I have it set to backup to iCloud but I can’t really figure out how to tell when the last update was? I’m assuming everything that I did on my phone today is gone (including the photos from the first time my baby went swimming which I’m now an emotional mother about) but how can I tell when my last back up actually was? 

Face ID stopped working about maybe a year or so ago, I attributed that to my having dropped the phone quite a lot (thank god for a strong case!) and knocked something out of whack. I’m guessing when it got wet this time it just ruined something and it doesn’t want to work now.

I haven’t tried anything other than hard restarting the phone twice (put it in a bag of rice now, but the phone actually seems to be turning on if the apple is showing up??) and plugging it into my laptop but that’s all. I’m open to any information about how to possibly get the phone restored so I can continue use, or how to pull any pictures from today off of it possibly.

My recommendation is to store it in a dry place, stop charging it, and don’t try to start it for at least a week or two. Then try starting it again.. Never put a iPhone in rice!!. Try this: take your phone apart and disconnect your battery. Then, make sure there is no water in there. Do not use rice but use silica gel in a sealed plastic bag. Then, disconnect the earpiece assembly and leave it disconnected and try turning the phone on. 

These two are to ensure that the logicboard isn’t fried as well as making sure that restore error isn’t caused by a bad earpiece assembly. Hope it helps a bit. Well, I back up my phone to the cloud, but not my photos as I take them so they aren’t accessible from my iPad. Pretty annoyed with myself, honestly!. Oops!. ..umm! Haha! I don’t know; that definitely sounds difficult??. Photos are, by default, also part of iCloud Backups, it’s just that those backups occur less frequently than just straight up syncing them with iCloud Photos. You’ll most likely have all of your photos as of a day or two before your phone got fried. If you don’t want to use iCloud, you can also download Google Photos in the future, which is a great alternative with free unlimited online space.

When you set up your new iPhone, select the “Restore from iCloud Backup” option and you’ll see a list of backups made in the past couple of weeks, with their respective dates listed as well. You can also see when your last automatic backup was on another iOS device if you are signed into the same iCloud account as your old phone was. On your, eg. iPad, go into Settings then tap on your name at the top. Then scroll down and select your old iPhone from the list. Under “iCloud Backup” you’ll see when the last backup was made. Hope that helped, and good luck!. Check dm.  Dm I can do it for you. Yeah I would definitely not do what he said if none of it sounds familiar.. Don’t have anything!.

I deleted some pics. Still full. Other was now 13gb. I deleted 400 pics, 5 huge chat threads, 8 100mb+ apps. Other was 18gb. 

I was going to back up and reset my phone. I was trying to back it up and it kept saying ""iPhone disconnected"". So I thought, ill restart it. I did, and it didn't boot. Just stuck on apple logo. I then tried to ""Update"" through recovery mode on my Mac with Catalina. Error 14. 

Tried USBC to lightning directly to my Mac, different ports, using the IPSW, etc. Ive error 14'd probably 10 times at least. So I decided I would restore from an old back up. 

I realize that if I restore my phone in recovery mode with finder, it will update to 13.5.1. Does this mean my backup is useless? Cause once its restored it will be 13.5.1, so I dont think I can restore from my back up from last month using 13.5?

Also buying an external tonight to backup my laptop to now because im traumatized and should've been backing it up already anyway. I did that. I had synced with iTunes multiple times. Other got bigger over the course of a few days so it was definitely charging overnight multiple days. Started at 10gb when I was 'full'. then at the end of that day it was 13gb. Next day it was at like 15 or 16gb. Then finally 18gb. I didnt specify the time frame differences in my op.

Other is a pandemic \*\*\* now, so still better to check this next time. From what I know cache won't be listed under app data usage and goes straight to Other, so yeah it could be the case.

Does the text and voicemail situation indicate B could have their number blocked by mistake? We've all talked about it and B says it isn't the case, nor would it be intended.


Could it be a bug of some kind? Any search results point to a blocked contact, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on here.

Seems like you checked the blocked numbers on the phone and on the phone provider website. 

Call Verizon and see how to update the profile on their network. Reset phone. 

Other then that I don’t know why the person is getting redirected or not receiving phones. Maybe it’s the provider of one of the phones as you said people are pretty far apart. Maybe they got some weird restrictions going on. 

Hope you figure it out. Let us know.. It does sound like contact b does have that phone number blocked tho. 🤷🏼‍♂️. Yea it’s super weird. Umm did B ever had a android before getting a I phone and used the same SIM card??
Is the text messages going to B green? Or blue?

Green means it thinks B is a non iPhone. If blue it knows it’s a iPhone. I phones don’t send SMS to another iPhones anymore they use MMS encryption service. It sends SMS to a non iPhone and it displays a green bubble. Maybe it’s that. Try to delete both contacts on both phones and create new contacts and try again. 

Go to settings. Go to messages on both phones and make sure the iMessage is on.  Turn on the sms also if iMessages isn’t available at any time. iPhones will try to send it in MMS but will eventually send it in SMS if needed to.

This is what mine looks like. 

Let me know if any of that works.. Any update??. Thanks for the replies - will look into that first and then try the other avenues. I appreciate the feedback.. Apparently contact B is still getting messages from A - would that happen if A is blocked on B's phone?. Phone B tried everything to update settings, delete and add A as a contact, etc. with no luck. Still have to circle back with A and check everything there.. If A (IPhone) is sending messages to B (iPhone) and B can see them then no A is not blocked on B phone. 

So the only problem is A calls B and B doesn’t get a ring and the call goes right to voice mail. Sounds like B doesn’t have A contact in his phone. And his iPhone has the silence unknown caller on his phone. 

Look in settings- phone - and under call silences
 Right above the block list. 

I believe if caller A calls B a few times right after the other. Caller B phone will finally ring as it thinks it’s a emergency. 

Here’s a article on it. From Apple. 

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099

If that doesn’t work I don’t know what caller B is doing with his phone. I’m sure it’s his phone that’s causing the problem. Is caller (B) a iPhone?. B is also an iPhone, yes.  

You're correct that A calls B and B doesn’t get a ring and the call goes right to voice mail.

A can text B. But when B texts A, A does not ever get the message.

I'll try to have B check what you mentioned about unknown callers, and maybe delete A as a contact and re-add. Any other ideas appreciated.  Thanks so much for your help so far!",595.0,14,186,0

At first, it was cute how interested she was in seeing how her voice changes the sound waves, but now it’s our least favorite thing. We let her use her iPad twice a day- in the early morning when she gets up before us, and for an hour during the day for “quiet rest time.”  (Yes, she has other toys and things to do... she mostly uses it to play a couple little SagoMini games... parental controls are on...) We have told her to stop yelling at it, and she will... until she remembers she has the app and starts doing it again. 

It’s gotten to the point where she uses it so much that not only is it driving us insane, her “memos” are taking up all the space on her iPad.  She has well over 1000 recordings and sometimes just doesn’t hit the end recording button so she’ll have 7 hours of just random talking throughout the day.

Mentioned above- I have tried to find an option to set screen time specifically for that app and I can't locate it anywhere.

Test with setting it for Other category, no way to set specific apps from what I've just tested (voice memos app is Utility). Another idea is to delete the app and set a block for AppStore so it can't be redownloaded without your permission. Would be much less hassle to re-install it twice a day if needed.

135,PPLEASE HELP ME!!!!// i accidentally dropped my iphone into water and i dont know what to do,h82951,2020-06-13 06:37:09,"so basically what happened was i was using my sink and my phone fell into the water and i grabbed it like 5 seconds after it fell in (and i have an iphone x so its a little water resistant) but after that happened, i put it in rice for around 3 hours and then it turned on while it was still in the baggie, and then i went to go do something and i used my phone before i went and did so, and then when i looked at it again after i was done with my thing about 20-30 minutes later, it was restarting with the apple logo and then turning off a couple secs after that popped up over and over again, so i put it in the bag of rice again and then same thing happened: after a little while, it turned back on again, but i turned it off so if there was any water it wouldn't interact with any of the components of the phone and like horribly damage it, and then ive been letting it sit in the baggie filled with rice powered off since for a couple hours now, and i dont really know what to do now, because i have somewhere to be tommorrow and i usually wake up with my phone alarm, so is it safe to use for tonight or should i wait until tommorrow or what should i do from here on? i looked at the sim card as well and there was no light or anything (probably because its powered off) and the slot didnt feel wet or anything like that either, please help me!!",1,0.67,20.0,"Somebody said ""Rice"". If you're talking about a water damaged device, I hope you know putting it in rice is just a myth. Rice is unable to pull moisture from inside your device. While waiting for the rice to do it's magic trick you're letting that moisture form corrosion. This corrosion can and will cause short circuits. If you truely would like to save your device please take it to a reputable repair shop immediately and do not try to charge or power your device on. Applying power will cause the corrosion to happen quicker by elecrolysis. If you have a removable battery please take it out.

Rice is the homeopathy of mobile repair or as /r/MobileRepair calls it Holistic Phone Repair.. At this point you’re probably better off not trying to use it, and take it to someone who can take it apart.. Usually you would want to leave it in the rice overnight... the damage might already be done though. If its less than a year old Apple might still have their no questions asked replacement policy/. The mods should really make it a term and response that this sub's automod looks out for too... (if there's an automod here). thank you for the advice! if rice doesn’t work then i guess my phone just turned on and started working because my iphone is water resistant(?) this has happened before and so far nothing’s been wrong with it.. too late 🤷‍♀️ thank you for the advice though!. okay thank you. >Somebody said ""Rice"".

>Rice is the homeopathy of mobile repair or as r/MobileRepair calls it Holistic Phone Repair.. Rice does nothing, please don’t recommend it. Also it’s water damaged, Apple will take one look at the water damage indicators and decline the repair.. I would highly recommend at least cleaning out the charging port with isopropyl alcohol before attempting to charge the device. Powering on the phone with any moisture can potentially short out and/or corrode the components. As below, your device started working again because the water began to evaporate. The damage has been done unfortunately and it's only a matter of time until it stops working again.

I'd recommend you take it to a repair company so they can clean it (most that do board repairs will have an ultrasonic cleaner that they can use to remove most of the corrosion on the surface).. Is it working?. I wish I could tell you something more helpful. With earlier phones that had removable batteries you could put the parts in rice individually and accelerate the drying time. Now you just have to leave it and pray all the moisture gets out of everywhere before using it again, or at least before pushing physical buttons.. i mean leaving it in rice overnight worked for me, but thank you for the advice. The corrosion started the instant water got inside it unfortunately. OP needs to have their device professionally looked at and cleaned if they want it to stand the best chance of not suddenly failing.. yeah it is actually, i think it may be because my iphone is water resistant + i pulled it out a couple seconds after it fell in. yeah after i left it in overnight everything turned out fine but thank you for replying!!. Rice really does nothing, it does not pull the moisture away from your device. As soon as you've got water in it the damage is done- corrosion is a chemical reaction and starts immediately.

The reason it has become a myth is because people leave their devices in rice for a few days and suddenly it works again, when the reality is simply that the water has evaporated from the internals.

As above once a device is water damaged, it will never be the same again. It might work for a few days, few months, a year etc. but it will always fail at some point due to the water.

See r/MobileRepair's automod's response for the mention of ""rice"" (which to be honest should be in this sub too...):

The glass on the front got broken where the top third of the display doesn't seem to register human touch.

I have one of those female USB-to-lightning adapters the try to hit it with my PC keyboard, but the iPhone reads this as an Accessory that needs to be unlocked to work.

Apple stores are closed, a call to the support line didn't yield much, and Best Buy was only able to tell me about replacement options. I have some photos I'd like to grab but I didn't sync my photostream with iCloud previously.

The camera app is currently grayed out, meaning the phone must have restarted once. That might be a blow to some solutions (like my adapter detailed below).

If you’re just going to grab a couple of pics off the phone, you could try sticking a protective screen cover on and going from there. It may be enough to navigate.. For the record - I got the display replaced at a mall kiosk phone repair and it totally worked and I was able to get back in. Well worth $130.. Got someone at a mall kiosk phone repair to replace the display and it worked like a charm. Thanks again!. I once did a full display repair back on the iphone 4, which was complicated. The problem here though is the display isn't registering touch on that top third, which means the display (and not just the glass) might be the problem. There's a white line running vertical across the display lengthwise, but doesn't seem to impact the lower numbers. I'll explore that tho thx.. I'm so glad to hear they got it working again!. Yeah it sounds like the entire display needs to be replaced. A majority of the time when someone replaces their Scream they do the entire assembly as opposed to just the glass.

I tried 3uTools and in the program it said that my phone is in DFU mode. That time I realised that the phone didn't have anything to do with a faulty battery. I tried restoring it by selecting there ""retain user data"" option. But it didn't work, it said that it could not enter restore mode.

I tried a couple of apps like Reiboot, Dr.Fone,PhoneRescue, but still not succes.

I realised I could not save the data on it, so I needed a full restore of the device. I tried using the iTunes method but it gave me the error 4014.

Does anyone know how long it can stay in water?,1,0.67,6.0,"Some 5 6 Hours In Rain But I Have iPhone X. Personally, I bought a waterproof Bluetooth speaker that hangs on my shower rack, that way I don’t have to risk my $1000 iPhone X in the shower. That would be my first recommendation. 

If you are going to have it with you in the shower I wouldn’t recommend putting it directly in the stream of water, it’s “resistant” not “water proof.” If you have a shelf where it might get splashed, that’s safer, but you still want to try to avoid contact with water. 

On [Apple’s website about water resistance](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207043) it says the following. 

To prevent liquid damage, avoid these:
-	Swimming or bathing with your iPhone
-	Exposing your iPhone to pressurized water or high velocity water, such as when showering, water skiing, wake boarding, surfing, jet skiing, and so on

So like I said, maybe if you have a place where it might accidentally get a little splash, like a shelf or something up high, you could try that. But I would really recommend a waterproof Bluetooth speaker, they aren’t expensive, seen them for $40 and they sound better than iPhone speakers.. Buy either waterproof case or bluetooth speaker waterproof. Bluetooth speaker better option as sound be louder.. I wouldn't bring it in touch with any liquid. It's only officially waterproof, and Apple doesn't apply their warranty to water damage. Many people had broken or damaged phones because they dropped their phone into the pool, the sink or because they used it in the shower. Don't.. One more vote for Bluetooth speaker. DO NOT take in to the shower with you. Steam is reasonably safe (but not for 4-5 hours ofc), but not the direct water impact. Don't join the army of idiots that decided to swim in the pool with an expensive piece of tech.

If you'll still decide to take a shower with the phone, better make an encrypted backup before this.. Its not water proof, its water resistant. Don't bring it into the shower.

It can handle rain and whatever water it normally should come in contact with, but a shower is stretching it into a ridiculous territory.",357.0,7,34,0

Better to use iCloud or iTunes to get iOS to sync them for you.. If you’re using the iCloud Photo Library, then the photos are not stored on your phone, they are in iCloud. You would need to download them from iCloud.com if you want them on your computer.. Connect the phone when it's unlocked and wait for 30-60 sec (keep it unlocked).

Can’t use it on MacBooks—but basically what they are saying to reinstall latest software update or update to newest using 3u. I’m almost certain you would need to enter dfu mode for this too & then flash it— basically what I said above, but you keep the data on the phone if it works.. Oh, yaw ah that was the problem, his phone needed to update but he updated it with his MacBook, but now we’re pretty sure all his data got deleted. I think he has it backed up but is not really my problem:/",220.0,10,52,0

I have a Samsung S8 and have no problems talking to anyone except her. 

Her kids also live in the home and have Iphone 10's and have no issue when taking to me or anyone else , so I am strongly leaning towards replacing her phone. She primarily uses it for voice calls, texting and a bit of social media and is not a tech kinda girl. 

I was thinking an Iphone 8 , but have no  clue if that would even be of help as I am ignorant of most things Iphone. 

Looking for possible solutions for the problem with her phone first and failing that , suggestions on what a decent replacement would be without breaking the bank.",3,1.0,11.0,"Could be a reception issue. Does she use a different carrier? If so, try a different provider.

If you’ve already restarted the device, you could try a factory reset. Make sure to backup the data through iTunes or iCloud first. Apple Support can also help you, either over the phone or online.

If all else fails, iPhone SE (2nd generation) is a very good option. It is incredibly future-proof and is amazing for the price. Otherwise, if you are looking for something a little cheaper, iPhone 8 is still a very capable device.

Hope this helps!. Does it sound like an underwater robot? I had this before. New SIM card fixed it. Have you tried swapping her sim into a known good iPhone?

Last time I had someone with similar issues it turned out to be an issue with the account somehow (unfortunately the user had already purchased new hardware). > not a tech kinda girl.

has it been updated (the ios)?  Settings > general > software update.    

also check

settings > cellular

can she turn on wifi calling?

check 'cellular data options'  is there an option for 'enable lte'?  (this is carrier dependent, so might not be there). Thanks for the reply!

I have reset her device and it had no effect. Her and her kids use the same carrier and although they are on newer phones I don't experience any issues when speaking with them.

IPhone SE is that newer than the 8?. Yes it does, but not constantly like that.. I had her try that and she does not have the option to turn on lte. It's there, but not enabled. She is with Virgin Mobile and I don't know if they have lte service.. Yes, it came out mid-April. It is an amazing device for the value! It has the A13 Bionic chip (currently found in the new iPhone 11 Pro), 4K video recording and IP67 water resistance (1m for 30 minutes). The US price is $399 for the 64GB configuration. If that sounds reasonable to her, it would be a good option. But otherwise, as I previously mentioned, the 2017 iPhone 8 can be found for relatively cheap online. Just make sure you’re buying from a reputable seller, if you decide on the 8.. not in the US?  virgin mobile us is now boost.

virgin mobile canada has lte I thought.

she might want to call whatever carrier she has and ask them to check her service.  maybe she's supposed to have the better voice calls. We are in Canada.. ok, yeah I guess it depends where you are

Many people are now using it as their primary mobile device now.

It’s fine for everything except hardware specific features of the 11 series.. I had an XS max and the battery life was about on par with my previous phone (note 9 exynos), now have the 11 pro max and its better than the battery on the note 10+ i had (also exynos). XS Max has a large size - and thus more battery. Although it has a bigger display too, the battery life on it should easily last you a day with normal usage. I have an iPhone X and it lasts almost a day for me so XS Max should easily do. Also, as many users pointed out, it is just one generation older and the A12 Bionic should last you a good 2.5+ years. One Plus 7 Pro is a great phone too, but the camera quality is mediocre when compared to an iPhone.. I’m a little late to the game , got an xs max new just a month ago. It’s good, battery life is not amazing since I came from an android device that has 5000mAh battery. But I can’t complain. Get about 4 hours screen on time for approx 40% battery usage.. I’m still using iphone 6+. Hardware mean nothing if your usage basic. Don’t follow new hype technology, buy what able afford. If I were to upgrade xs max the one I will choose. 👍. It’s an incredible phone for a great price comparable in every aspect to the 11.. XS Max has OLED screen my iPhone 11 still does not it’s a good buy. I have the XS max I bought brand new, couple thoughts.  Its an awesome well designed phone that takes great pictures.  The screen still look great and its actually pretty rugged, I dont use screens or nothing, just out here raw dogging life!  Yeah I understand the risks, and I have had to replace screens on different devices in the past.  But not this one, survived A couple decent falls!  When I first got the phone I took it on A trip to Japan, my GF had A 6, went an entire day using the phone pictures, texts, music everything!  Still had A ton of battery left, my GF was on an external charger before the midway point with the same usage.  But that comes with the territory, its starting to slow down now and the battery is getting old and starting to run down faster.

I don't think so.. Could I go for a full day with the XS Max with a few hours of use?. Still a while until I upgrade, but the XS Max is somewhere on the top of my list so far.. I don't know honestly, even the 64GB iPhone 11 is super expensive here ($900) and if the new iPhone will have the latest and greatest, especially 5G, it will be even more expensive, hence why I'm looking to get something a bit older, a 256GB XS Max costs about $650 atm which I think is a fair price. Easily. i think you should do a google search, the new phones are going to be starting at a lower price point this year. I really can't decide, either save up a little more and get a oneplus 7 pro, or the XS Max.

Or use the migrate from android feature during setup..

During a call it can work as normal but then it will drop to low volume. Then return to normal volume. I always have my volume on full.

It’s as if the other person has moved away from their phone. I’ve asked various people If they’ve moved away from the phone and they haven’t. 
I’ve been on 3 or 4 bars network signal in one location, so don’t think it’s a signal problem.

Could software updates be offered longer because the processor is so good sure, but we don’t know apples plans.

I'm not very interested in phones or up to date with models and releases but I'm pretty sure it's an Iphone 8 plus and it probably has the most up to date iOS

2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

It's my work phone, I didn't buy it. I live in Sweden but this has so far only happened to me and my colleagues while working on a project in Germany.

3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

Today I saw it happen in front of my eyes, I pulled up my phone to take a picture and as I was about to snap the picture the screen just started showing thin white vertical lines on a grey background, the screen became brighter and brighter for thirty seconds until it went all black. It reacts to no buttons, nothing happens when I put in the charger, when I ask someone to call me it's like it's turned off. But last time it happened to me and to most of my colleagues, it will just start working in a couple of days again.

It occurs when we weld. At a certain stage of my job we have a 10 hour shift where we TIG-weld copper. It is somehow related to that because it always happen during that shift but while I'm annoyed I'm dying to know the exact cause. We only have DC in our TIG torches when welding copper. It's a fairly powerful welding machine able to output upwards 450 Ampere required for copper welding.

4. What caused the issue?

I'm not sure about the exact cause. Today when it happened the welding machine was turned on standing maybe 1,5 meters away but noone was running it since maybe 30 minutes. 

5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

Me and my colleagues try to not wear the phones in our pockets while we weld. We need to be able to take photos and to be reached, so I still kept them around, so I guess at this point a solution to have it not happen in the future is to keep the phone in another building as we do this but that's annoying.

6. Any other information you think might be useful.

We think it's only these newer Iphones it's happening to. But it also only happens when we're in Germany. Maybe that's all a coincidence but it's just so weird. I moved the SIM-card to another, older Samsung phone, and it's working fine. Maybe it's relevant, the item we weld is high voltage DC conductors for power transmission.

Does anyone have any ideas what it might be doing this, or how I could get my phone to start working again right away?",19,0.96,28.0,"No idea what is the issue here, but wow man, congrats on the perfect “help” post. I think I’m in love.. welding equipment puts out EMF like crazy.  we used to see welder's pickup trucks dying because it would fry the engine control module in them

electromagnetic fields can freak out electronics....why it's dead for a few days and not forever, I'm not sure.  maybe the battery goes into deep discharge and takes awhile to come back.

you could try one of those RF shielding bags or wrap it in foil, and then step far away when you want to use it.. Wasn’t there a story about a gas leak in a hospital that disabled all the iPhones until the gas  dissipated?. Nicely detailed post. 

If you ever find out the cause please let me know. I’m interested in figuring this out.. 2cents
“DC voltage is the only voltage that will attempt to turn into AC”
While welding with DC the voltage creates a frequency while the amperage heats up the metal to weld
I think the generator / welder has a problem leaking AC under load  or a bad internal ground or a bad phase. 
This is just a pure guesswork.. Are these cables live?. Your answer to #4 suggests a helium leak at the German site? 

&#x200B;

 (by now, others have already mentioned helium)

[https://www.ifixit.com/News/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium](https://www.ifixit.com/News/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium). UPDATE: So 4 days since it died, I realized only yesterday how known the issues with Iphone 8 and helium were by googling ""Iphone 8 helium"", I saw the fixit article and even how Apples user guide says they don't go well together. So the link is definitely there, and it seems unnecessary for me to test my phone in a plastic bag since others have already done that and documented on youtube. 

Now it's not like I spray my phone with helium while we weld, and noone starts talking funny because of it but we operate in a 170m3 room, and during 8-12 hours we use up about 1½ 50l flask of helium pressurized to 200 bar. We seal the room as well as possible but we run the air in the room through a dehumidifier so I have no idea how much helium builds up. But it seems conceivable that with those conditions, enough of these little helium atoms could find their way into whatever part it is that makes this happen. 

I guess I can't be 100% sure this is the issue but it makes sense in a beautiful way, and it was really exciting to find about this. I read somewhere that Apple said to leave the phone to completely discharge for about a week before charging again should bring it back up, which matches our earlier experience. I guess in the future the best solution is to just not bring the phone to this workspace for this time. Which would be probably be the same solution as if I had concluded it would have been another aspect of this welding process that did the damage, but it still points to the gas.

Thanks for taking your time helping me out, it didn't cross my mind that it could be the gas before you guys brought it up.. Art.. Cool, thanks for your reply. It makes sense that weld -> EMF -> electronics acting up but it's just so specific that it keeps on happening here. We've used the same welding machines for other jobs but me and my colleagues haven't seen it happen anywhere but in Germany. That might just be a coincidence that we happen to be working here at the same time as we are being issued a phone that are sensitive to just whatever this machine does.

I googled deep discharge and that seems a bit scary, is it safe to me to leave the phone with charger plugged in while I sleep? Is there a solution to recover Iphones from this state or is it just not supposed to have it happening to them?. Yup! Gassed caused some sort of issue inside displays which lead to it not being able to be used (don’t remember too specifically) 
I think it was solved after putting it in a ziplock bag but idk for sure.. Helium. It's used to super cool magnets. Penetrates and kills the oscillator used for cpu clock timing. Remember this too! It was some sort of gas that leaked which caused internal components to run faster than normal which apparently wasn’t good.. Yeah it was related to one of the sensors that has like a tiny crystal in it and freaks out in the presence of some kind of gas or mri machine or whatever it was. I tried to find the YouTube video I saw for you but can’t find it :/. Nope, but there is risk of induced current due to nearby overhead lines. Although we never measured or noticed any problems with that but we do take precautions for this, grounding metallic parts.. I'd be curious if the phone is recognized by itunes on a computer when in that state.  or if it would response to a force reset.. Are they tig welding with high frequency a/c?. It's actually the oscillator not being able to function properly anymore.

Because of this the CPU freezes and isn't able to boot itself back up anymore. Helium is the shielding gas we use when welding copper. There's also nasty fumes so we wear a welding mask with ventilation on it. 

But it seems weird to me that gas could be the culprit when it only seems to target certain models of phones.. And induced current is where i was heading. But i think the helium could be the cause now that I've discovered you are using it.. It doesn't seem to respond to the things I try that I found from googling ""force reset iphone 8"".

The phone might be dead forever but I have my hopes up that it returns in a couple of days. Only DC for copper but machines are capable of running AC as well.. Any suggestion for how I could try to find out if this could be the cause? We use helium as shielding gas when we weld and there are some fumes that we avoid with ventilation.. Crazy. I think you found your link. I just assumed for whatever reason the shielding gas would have been argon or nitrogen or something.

Not all devices are made the same. It would make sense for this to be the cause, but not effect every device and location.

Try this. Triple bag your devices in zip lock bags (the helium will find its way in either way). See if it mitigates the occurrences to some degree. If you use helium, fat chance thats it. The symptoms match

Not sure how you could shield the phone from helium. I guess putting it in a baggie would help, but helium can actually propagate through the bag ever so slightly. But might be your best try to start with.

If it doesn't freeze when being in a sealed plastic bag, you can be fairly confident its the air mixture.. Crazy indeed, FYI helium is necessary for quality welding copper! And thank you!. Day 3, it's still dead but I'm thinking that if it starts working again, I might just put it in a plastic bag, vacuum it and then fill it up with helium outside, out of the presence of the welding machine, just to try this theory.. Just need to put a tiny bit of it in there, it's fairly sensitive.

No need to test it though, as helium is known for iPhones to give these issues.

Is it working now though? Usually takes 2-6 days until it works again depending on how much helium it has been in contact with",1300.0,25,463,0

[images](https://imgur.com/a/wtSlQKz). I don't know but it is very well over a couple of hours a day. 

If I had to put a guess, cumulatively might've been over a hundred hours. Apple will regard it as normal wear and tear unfortunately (the same as any other manufacturer).

You might be able to make it disappear by applying a tempered glass screen protector (a tempered glass one specifically, as it will better mask where the coating has rubbed off).. yes I am planning to use a tempered glass but I was simply curious as to whether I can get rid of those patches before doing so.

however is there any way that one can do something by themselves? or is it not worth the risks associated with doing so. Get some IPA (isopropyl alcohol- *don't* use any other alcohol such as ethanol) and rub the screen, you won't need to use much force and the coating will start to come off.

Do this for the entire screen and then apply the tempered glass screen protector. Use a microfibre cloth to remove any fingerprints or dust before applying it.. so basically taking it all off to make it homogeneous, alright then.

also is there a way that after taking the entire thing off you can reapply an oleophobic coating evenly? 

which option would you go for actually, simply getting a tempered as it is rn or doing it after taking off the entire coating.. I'd remove the coating and then apply the tempered glass. I've seen products that claim to effectively re-apply the coating but have never seen one do what it says on the tin (aka, they don't work properly).

Search Google for ""macbook staingate remove coating"" for a step-by-step guide on removing it (the same problem of a coating coming off, but not the same root cause- will still apply here though).. thanks a lot :). They work properly if you use them as directed. I am speaking from experience with the Crystal Armor Fusso oleophobic coating. Applying it properly requires patience and time, but it works as long as you do it correctly. One bottle is about $15 and it is enough for 1 ***full*** application. That's why it's a tiny bottle.

Now, here is how you use it (all of these steps are actually pretty easy to perform, and they all count as 1 full application):

1. Apply 10-15 drops evenly over the glass. Don't try to be perfect, you won't be able to do it perfectly.
2. Before it evaporates, spread it evenly to cover 100% of the glass using something that doesn't absorb liquid. I used a squeegee. **DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED BLACK MICROFIBER CLOTH**. That's just a free gift included with your purchase to help you with your daily cleaning of the glass.
3. Using a facial tissue or a paper towel, simultaneously rub it in and wipe it off.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 above 3 more times for a total of 5 mini applications (not to be confused with a full application)
5. Repeat steps 1-**2** above just 1 time.
6. Let the evenly-spread oleophobic coating product sit untouched for 8 or more hours. This is the curing process. This is the critical stage most people don't have the patience for and it's why they say it doesn't work. Thanks to Voice Control, you can still use the iPhone without touching it. So set it up before you do all of this. Don't be fooled into thinking just an hour or two is good enough. 8 or more hours. The longer the better. That's just how this stuff works.
7. After the 8+ hours of curing time, wipe off the excess until the glass *looks* clean. Use a facial tissue or a paper towel or a clean cotton cloth that you're willing to put into the laundry basket after because this stuff is a little bit oily. Don't touch the glass while you're doing this, or after.
8. Now use a wet paper towel or a wet cotton cloth (not dripping wet, just wet enough to clean the glass) and clean off the remaining oily residue that I guarantee you cannot see but it's there. So again, I advise try to avoid touching the display glass until you've completed this step, otherwise it'll be on your skin. It's a subtle oily residue. I'm sure you don't want to accidentally get it in your mouth or your eyes or transferred to some of your belongings.

After step #8 above, you will have completed the 1st of 5 full applications. Do this for 5 days in a row, and I guarantee you the glass will feel just like new for the next 6-8 months, just like Apple's oleophobic coating. Again, I'm speaking from experience.

Edit: After 1-2 or even 3 full applications, you'll believe you've done enough applications because it will feel brand-new again, but don't be fooled. Make sure you do all 5 full applications.",916.0,4,140,0
263,I got locked out of my iPhone 8+,gy96g4,2020-06-07 09:29:50,"Hi everyone.

Two days ago, my iPhone of nearly 2 years stopped functioning normally. None of my alarms rang that morning - I couldn't click on anything. I restarted my phone a couple of times only to be stuck at the Apple logo for hours. 

I did a hard reset and plugged my phone into my laptop to get it into recovery mode. I had it install an update, but my laptop suddenly went on sleep mode and lost all its progress. I was left with no choice but to restore my phone. And I did. 

After restoring, my phone prompts a message to say about 'remote management' and that a certain company (I won't name) has control over my phone. An apple tech guy also walked me through recovery mode, but we got the same result. His hunch is that this phone used to belong to that company and only decided to lock it now (and that he'll help me escalate this problem next week, but that my homework is to contact the company). I restored my phone 4 times in total that day. 

Let's just say I wasn't received with warmth by the company, and they may not be the solution to my problem. I contacted the seller too, who was happy to reply and escalate to his supplier (he has 100% rating on eBay, and I was sure at least then that I bought this phone brand new - I even checked it with my serial ID and it says I have a valid purchase date). He said he'll keep me posted. 

I guess at this point, I'm trying to think about my options (buying a new phone being the very last resort). Is there any way I can go around this, or is my iPhone useless now? (I'm located in Australia, if that's of any help warranty-wise). 

Thanks in advance.",3,1.0,10.0,"Provide proof of purchase to Apple, where:

* Shows the device sold as new.
* Shows the seller's information where they are established as a business.
* The purchase date roughly aligns with the date the device was activated on (only Apple can see this, should be within a month or so of the purchase date).

If the proof of purchase has all the above, Apple should be able to validate you as the owner and be able to remove the remote management lockout.

  
Not sure how Apple's remote management works, but it might work by simply entering the serial number into the system- if so it's reasonable to assume the company it's now locked to entered one of the serial numbers incorrectly.. The restore is what triggered it.  The device was either owned by the company you won’t name, or by one of its employees and the enrolled it in MDM... and it was never un-enrolled.

From the companies point of view you shouldn’t have it, and unless they come to the table you are officially out of luck.. Awesome, I'll try this approach. Thanks so much!. That doesn’t work for remote management at all that’s for find my iPhone. Aaah no :( okay. I hope I can get some sort of refund from the seller.. No, it’ll work for remote management too. 

FMI requires additional proof of ownership than proof of purchase.. This is what I’ve done when helping people in the past.

If the eBay seller can provide proof that it was a new device, Apple may be able to remove the MDM, depending on the type of MDM it’s enrolled in.. [removed]. You opting to try and offend me says otherwise. MDM is a service offered by Apple for private companies via its Enterprise scheme, unlocking a device from MDM is not a legal issue if you are the legal owner of the device.

It was simply a suggestion, and I never said it would 100% work. 

However if Apple refuses to remove MDM with proof of purchase, the company who locked the device refusing to remove MDM, and the seller refuses to refund, I see no alternative but to take both that company and the seller to small claims (assuming the OP _really wanted_ their device back working properly). 

I’d imagine the initiation of a small claims against them would be enough to get them to remove it, and even if not you have documentation that verify beyond doubt that it is your device. 

MDM is monitoring software, not sure what the laws are over in the US but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was highly illegal to place spying software on someone’s device without their permission (or being a law enforcement agency).. I’m pretty sure MDM can’t be removed by Apple. The serial number is essentially in that company’s database.",472.0,8,313,0

This is why it's necessary to recalibrate the battery once every few months. Do it now. Here's how:

1. Allow the power to run out until iOS shuts down automatically
2. Plug it in and leave it plugged in until the iPhone finishes recharging to 100%. Don't unplug it until it's done. Note: it could take 1-2 hours for the iPhone to turn back on and start up after you plug it in. This doesn't happen when you regularly recalibrate the battery.
3. When it's finished charging to 100%, shut down the iPhone and unplug it.
4. Start the iPhone back up (so yeah, turn it back on)

Repeat this about 4-5 times. You can try to do it all in one day, or one time per day. It doesn't matter. 4-5 times will be necessary since this is likely the first time you've ever done it with this old iPhone.

After you're done with the 1st of 4-5 0-100% recharges, you will notice a big improvement to the battery level reading's accuracy and you might even get slightly more battery power before you have to recharge.

And yes, what is the Maximum Capacity reading? (it's not ""Battery Health"", it's ""Maximum Capacity"", located in the Battery Health section of the Battery settings).

Finally, do you restart your iPhone regularly? That keeps battery level readings reasonably accurate in between recalibrations.. the maximum capacity is 50% because of had this phone for a long time. will try. and the maximum capacity is 50%. Anything below 80% should be replaced (especially if you’re having power issues). Holy shit. Get the battery replaced ASAP.. yeah either that or i’ll just get a new phone. iPhone 11! :)

I did some research and I came to the conclusion that I should replace my battery. I don’t want to waste money and replace it just for it to not fix anything, so I wanted to know if it would fix the extreme battery draining if I replaced my battery.

TL;DR Phone battery draining quickly, would replacing battery fix my problem?",2,1.0,5.0,"There is a PC application called 3utools which you can use to see how many cycles the battery has been through. iPhone batteries last about 500 cycles, so if yours is showing 400+ cycles, then it is worth considering replacing the battery.

If you discharge the battery to 50% and charge it up. Discharge it to 50% and charge it up, then that is one charge cycle. 

As the battery ages from time and discharge cycles, it will become less efficient. By about 500 cycles, the battery would show approximately 80% capacity. The Iphone 6 capacity is 1810mAh, after 500 cycles, it would have about 1448mAh (80%). This will show up as ""100%"".",209.0,7,152,0

276,Intermittent cell signal loss. Apple blames carrier. Carrier blames Apple. Frustrated.,gxwrc8,2020-06-06 18:55:50,"**Summary of issue:** Several times per day, my iPhone 11 Pro will suddenly completely lose cell service. It’ll go from 4 bars to 0 bars, during which time I can’t place calls or use cellular data. This happens in several different geographic locations so it’s not a signal issue. Furthermore, my work phone uses the same carrier and doesn’t have these issues. After a minute or two, the service returns and it works like usual. 

**What I’ve done to try to fix it:** My first move was to call Apple since I have AppleCare+. Apple had me take several troubleshooting steps including checking for Carrier Setting Updates, Resetting Network Settings, and erasing the phone and starting over as a new phone. None of these solutions fixed my problem. 

Next, they had me call my carrier (FirstNet, which uses AT&T towers). My carrier reprovisioned the phone, and then sent me a physical SIM card to replace the eSIM which I had been using. Neither of these fixed the issue. 

Back to Apple, who me install a profile to collect more detailed Baseband logs. Engineers at Apple still blame my carrier based on the logs. 

I’ve been having this problem for over a month now. I told Apple I’d like a new phone since I think it’s pretty clearly a hardware issue. They warned me repeatedly that I’d be charged the full retail price of the phone if they aren’t able to replicate the issue. This issue is so infrequent that I seriously worry they won’t be able to reproduce the issue and I’ll be screwed out of $1,000. 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",2,1.0,6.0,"> erasing the phone and starting over as a new phone. 

does this mean you've done a restore in itunes?  or just erased all the settings?

usually a restore is seen as a complete ground-up reinstallation of ios.  if that doesn't fix it, it's hardware.

so the apple techs haven't physically seen it?  are apple stores near you opened?   They might swap it out there if they can test it.

have you made records of when this issue occurs?  I guess you could contest it with your credit card company if they falsely charge you.  By then you'll have a new phone, hopefully that doesn't fail, so that's proof it was the phone.. Call apple again, explain what they are going through, and try to talk to a senior advisor. This is definitely some sort of failing baseband of a fucked resister near the sim tray. This is a very similar symptom on my iPhone XS Max and I have sent it out to Apple for a replacement. Currently waiting for mine.. Update: After the second Senior Advisor I spoke to on 6/4 failed to call me back on 6/6 as he promised, I called Apple today (6/7). The third Senior Advisor was very apologetic and was happy to set up an express replacement for me. Hopefully this issue will be resolved with the new phone. I’m fairly confident it will be.. I completely erased the phone and then restored from a backup. I guess I’ll erase the phone and then manually reinstall my apps to completely rule out a “tainted” backup. 

Unfortunately my local Apple Store is still closed. I’m thinking of making a bit of a road trip to the nearest open Apple Store because I’m guessing that a tech would swap it without making a hassle if I’m physically there and explain that I’ve been given the runaround for a month now.. I’ve be working with the same senior advisor for about 3 weeks. I called Thursday and talked to a different senior advisor. The latter was the one who warned me about being charged for a new phone. He’s supposed to call me back today with an update from their engineers. 

I agree it’s likely a failed hardware component, but trying to convince Apple of this is proving tough. If I don’t get a call back today, I’ll call tomorrow and roll the dice again on a senior advisor.. And one more update for anyone who cares. I had emailed Tim Cook about these issues. Just had a member of Apple’s Executive Team call me and he’s taking ownership of the case. Wow! Hoping the new phone fixes it though.",448.0,11,272,0

279,One iPhone in our group can't do group messages with an Android recipient,gxvsoz,2020-06-06 18:01:05,"Hi,

We are trying to do a group family chat and my mom's phone (iPhone 8) is fine for group messages until we add my phone (Galaxy S10) into the recipients. My wife also has an iPhone 8, exact same phone, and there are no issues with having me in the the group chat. iMessage and MMS messages are both enabled and all message-related settings between my mom's phone and wife's phone look to match.

281,iPhone 7 recover photos/videos after Reset procedure possible?,gxucll,2020-06-06 16:44:23,"Hi,

I consider myself tech-oriented, have a lot of experience with tech gear, software, computers etc. Just to clear that line out.

Now, I don't personally use iPhone, my colleagues and friends around me do and I have limited experience, e.g. performed setup and registrations for friends in the past, installed few apps and so on.

And one important friend just had a **weird accident with her iPhone 7**. The internal memory was full, she cleared few old photos and videos to make some room for new ones, and decided to **restart (reboot)** the phone to see if it will make it run smoother.

And that's when the problem occurred. The phone shown a message that it is now **locked and to connect to iTunes to unlock it**. That message does not happen unless you make a mistake **10 times to try to unlock it (brute force protection)**, but she **denies** that that ever happened. It's her own phone, not stolen one obviously, and she **never changed her password** in the last 3 (or 4?) years.

Anyhow, she gave me the phone to try recover it, since her laptop is some ancient one on Win 7 and iTunes no longer works properly there (phone requires newer version).

I installed iTunes on my Win 10 laptop, everything went fine, phone was started in recovery mode, but during the ""update"" recovery procedure (non-destructive) phone stopped the update process, and iTunes reported that it cannot be updated because of an unknown error.

Ok, next thing, the only thing left, really, was factory reset via iTunes, I entered all the Apple ID and unlock pin credentials, and it was done.

**Phone is now factory clean. And it works 100% fine. But it is empty :(**

\*\*\* She DOES NOT have: \*\*\*

**1) any iTunes backups**

**2) iCloud or other cloud backups (iCloud was off)**

**Is there a \*\*\*beeping\*\*\* way to recover some photos and videos from her phone?**

AppStore is useless (US country), when I enter ""**photo recovery**"" in search, I get the whole crap apps in there. I'm all Android, at least we have **DiskDigger** and tons of other options (in particular, if we have external memory card storage).

Any, and I really mean, any app for Windows that advertises like crazy on Google for iPhone recovery is useless, since they either find no photos at all, just calendar and similar things (unimportant) or require **iTunes/iCloud backup** something. I have tried at least 10 of them, and traditional apps like Recuva and alike do not see iPhone as a storage device, since it's mounted like a media something crap (MTP device).

Sorry for the long post, but my Saturday is ruined anyway, and is there any way that really works?

I got an idea to use **iExplorer** to mount it as a **FAT32 Windows drive**, and it was like hell hard to find a matching iTunes version that will work with iExplorer properly, but it was a no go, either. Software like **Recuva** complained about unrecognized file system, and **Stellar Phoenix** *something* successfully scanned it (in like 5-6 minutes, which was odd), but didn't find a thing. It's a virtual device driver that goes through iTunes, so it was a long shot anyway, but still... pity.

I can run a **Linux Ubuntu** disk, but not sure how the device is going to be mounted there and what recovery apps options are available. Does anyone have any idea in this regard?

Any idea?

BIG thank you!",2,1.0,5.0,"No I’m sorry, there’s most likely no way you could restore them, even with a Linux restore utility, since when the phone is reset through the 10 attempts it’s securely erased over and data is written over several times to get rid of any chance of recovery. Impossible to recover content after a reset unfortunately.. No, even if the data was still there (which it isn’t because it securely erased), the data is encrypted with a unique identifier which is different with every factory reset. So when you reset, the drive gets reencrypted with a new and different key, making recovery impossible. This is done on purpose and is a safety feature. 

Live and learn, iCloud backup was turned off (default is on), so they made that choice of not having backups.. Thank you, all for your replies. I was afraid that this was the case :(. Thank you. Yeah, I was afraid of that and prepared her for such unfortunate outcome. Weird thing is that she denies any wrong password attempts whatsoever... it's a bit suspicious :)",178.0,8,563,0

285,iPhone X won’t start up. Stuck on Apple logo.,gxr5vz,2020-06-06 13:39:28,"Hello, I am looking for some help with my girlfriends iPhone X. 

First let me give you the details,

It’s an iPhone X, not sure on the firmware. I think it was 13.3. I bought it from my friend second hand for her but there weren’t any issues other than the back glass being smashed. Haven’t had any other issues with the phone until today. Hasn’t been dropped, no water damage and haven’t tried to update it and anything happen midway through so I’m at a loss to the problem. 

My girlfriend woke up this morning to her phone not turning on after being on charge overnight. I have tried the hard reset as well as recovery mode and dfu mode but her mac doesn’t recognise the phone when it is plugged in but it recognises mine so the problem lies with the phone not anything else. 

When plugging into the wall to charge it gives the battery charging indication and then starts to boot up with the Apple logo but won’t go past that. It will sit on this screen forever.

Basically I’m just wondering if anyone experienced this or has any advice of what to do next. 

I spoke to Apple support but they only told me everything I already knew then gave me a quote of £600+ to fix it which is ridiculous when I only paid £100 for the phone. 

If there is nothing I can do then she’ll just get a new phone but if it’s possible to fix it I wanna give it a go. 

Thanks in advance for reading my post and if there’s any info I missed out please let me know!",2,1.0,16.0,"If DFU doesn’t work, you’re looking at a hardware issue.  Apple’s ‘repair’ would probably be hardware replacement. Might be the face ID flex cable, or charging port cable. If you unplug one of them it might work. I have experience with this! This usually happens when an iPhone with FACE ID (iPhone X, xs, etc...) has some sort of damage with the rake piece assembly. If you can open the phone up and disconnect the earpiece ribbon, your phone will boot right up, and you can use it again, of course with no Face ID. I would recommend going to a phone repair shop, suggest them to disconnect the earpiece ribbon and try turning it on. This is the exact same issue I had with my iPhone XS and using that same device to write this, with the assembly disconnected. This can definitely end with a $30 repair.. ew, doesn't sound good.  if itunes doesn't recognize it, it's probably a hardware issue

try cleaning out the lightning port with a toothpick, try a different cable, different  computer if possible.

do the freezer trick (seal it in a plastic bag, put in freezer for half an hour).  then see if itunes sees it. Doesn’t sound promising!. Interesting! Are you able to use Face ID again now? Can you replace the part in question?. This worked! Phones up and running with the earpiece ribbon disconnected. So if I replace the earpiece part it will fix the problem and allow the earpiece to be used? Is the reason the Face ID won’t work because of encryption? Is there a way to get the Face ID to work with a new earpiece part without getting Apple to do it?. Thanks for the reply! Cleaned the lightning port already, tried multiple cables and even tried a windows laptop. All no good. I haven’t tried the freezer trick though so I’ll give that a go!. The freezer trick will do nothing for a phone, please do not suggest it.  
It can cause damage to the battery.  


OP needs to send the device to a microsolderer for a diagnosis.. You can replace the part and earpiece will work again but FACE ID will never work unless the screen is replaced by apple. I’m glad the phone is back up and running! Unfortunately, the earpiece has the proximity sensor as well as the flood illuminator(crucial for FACE ID) and they are paired to the phone. Therefore, unless replaced by apple it can’t be brought back to life. There are people with “GSX Accounts” but they aren’t legit most of the time and kinda shady to about. If you replace it’d FACE ID will be gone but you can continue using it as a phone.. good luck.

the next thing would be to open it up and press on all the connectors.  again, not a high rate of success, but easy enough.. ha! no one in alaska or canada can own an iphone!

I'll see if anyone else has tips! I would just go to an Apple store and ask, but I don't think they are open yet.. Emails & messages will still sync.  The biggest impact would be if you use iCloud Drive to store & access files like documents from both devices.  iCloud Drive is also involved with storing Home app data.

Did a newly added iPhone text replacement sync after you turned iCloud Drive off?  Or was it a replacement that was already synced?  If the latter, it is because you have to delete the existing ones on the Mac.  They are under System Preferences > Keyboard, Text..

Or not getting bigger iphone simply.. Your iPhone 11 is messed up. The A13 crushes the Note 10. The 11 does have a bad screen, but the speaker quality, call quality, and performance should be very good.. Every other iphone in the lineup has one of the best for screens on the market but yet he gets the smallest and worst and then wonders why he hates it. Ummm I kinda agree with everything but the speakers part. They sound OK, not great. They distort a lot after 70% volume. Like, A LOT. Depending on the genre/song, music is sometimes unlistenable for me because of the distortion. At 50% volume they sound good tho.. I mean screen isnt that bad tbh,but he has named like 5 more thing that bother him,ehich are simply not true,i onow ppl who got 11 regilar one and speakers are so fkin loud same goes for call quality,and in terms of lagg there is none becuse apples software and hardware implementation,main reason why people still choose iphone over anything elae is longevity and smoothnes even on 60hz displays",411.0,10,53,0

Hi,

I recently purchased a iPhone Xs after owning an Android phone for several years.

It's been a long time since I last owned an iOS phone and I forgot that unlike Android, iOS has a lot of limitations on what files you can access on the phone.

I am currently using iTunes and the File Sharing option to try to access files and while I can see a list of file sharing apps as well as the root directory for each file sharing app...I am not able to drill down and open any of the folders/sub directories to add or copy files inside of the folders.

I can however add or copy files and folders on the root level.

Why does Apple allow access to the root directory for each file sharing app to add or copy files or folders but then restricts us from opening the folders in order to add or copy files inside of the folders?

Kind regards,

\-Iphone 7, 128gig,  running IOS 13.5 (up to date) 

\- purchased 1 week ago via Amazon in the U.S.

First I should address I am aware of the bug causing the ""cellular update failed"" on some iPhone 7's specifically. Makes the phone think it has no service etc. I know you can (or could?) return to Apple for a fix.

My original iPhone 7 (which I had for many years) NEVER had this problem. I just had dropped it, broken the camera, drained the battery, etc and it was time to replace. I'm broke AF at the moment and wanted to go for a cheaper refurb option. So I got the same iPhone 7 with the same specs but refurbished from BestBuy. One day in had this problem. Returned it - bought another one from Amazon. Again, it had this problem but except this time on and off sometimes for days at a time. 

THE QUESTION IS: is there any world where two separate model# iPhone 7's have this issue - or could this be a problem with my AT&T account or my sim card (the only common denominator between the 3 phones). I know a refurb is a sketchy option but I just don't want to spend the cash on a new phone - especially if this can be fixed.

if on the icloud, try the icloud for windows app. Plug your iPhone into your pc, go to windows explorer, find your iPhone, right click -> import photos and videos.

This can also be done through the very buggy windows 10 photos app if you have windows 10.. Just use google photos you can then later delete them off your phone.

1. Amazon Photos - unlimited photo storage with Prime, only a few GB of video.
2. Google Photos - free backup of all photos and videos at reduced quality
3. OneDrive - I have a Microsoft 365 subscription, so currently 1TB space. This is my master, saving all photos and video at full quality.

I use Google Photos to delete the photos/videos after they are backed up to all three. If you can't see the DCIM folder, connect the phone while it's unlocked and wait for 30-60 sec.

If you get Disconnected error, go to Settings > Photos and change to ""Keep originals"" at the very bottom (there's a known issue with errors during HEIC > JPEG conversion step).

If still won't work (issues with transferring 4k videos), get [iMazing](https://imazing.com/). Never had any troubles with it for photos transfer.. They remain on the iPhone.

Now for the tech gurus, Is there anyway i can get the contents on that app and the app itself OFF my iphone 7 and onto my laptop or something?

++ If yes you should be able to back up then reset your phone and restore from backup. Or an program like iExplorer might be able to help. Yes you can get it back does it show on you’re purchasing. Where was the app from originally?

Depends if it saves things in a format and location you can get to.. No you can’t do either :/. Well i think so? I know i can back up photos/notes etc etc to icloud or transfer on to laptop but what other back up can you do? Can you backup all apps data etc??. its not there unfortunaetly. App was just on the App Store! It’s actually imusic. Yes, so through iTunes you can do a full backup of your phone (this includes app data, messages, photos, notes, settings preferences, etc etc)

To do this:

1. Plug in your phone into your computer
2. Click trust this computer on your iPhone if it pops up
3. Open iTunes on your computer, you should see an iPhone icon on the left side of the screen
4. Click the iPhone icon and you will see a screen about software updates and backups
5. Click “backup to this computer”, then click apply at the bottom right
6. Click “back up”
You should now see a progress bar at the top of the screen indicating the progress of the backup, as well as a sync animation in the status bar of your iPhone

Once the backup is complete you will see a message that says “last backup on [date] [time]”

++once you have your phone backed up you will be able to restore your phone with that backup once the issues are fixed. Or you can put the backup on any iPhone running an iOS version the same or higher than the backup. Where does it save stuff?. Your amazing! Thank you..

Is this the right section??  Your telling me that if i tick off 'Back up all data from this iphone on mac'  and then 'back up' and that will just back up the data from an 'Imusic' app that has private app storage??

[https://imgur.com/a/0ZvCkAw](https://imgur.com/a/0ZvCkAw). It saves stuff within the app! So the app has a search function (you tubes search engine) you search a vid and it instantly downloads it to the app. Yup! As long as the app is still on your iPhone which it sounds like it is... Also make sure you know your encryption password, if you lose / forget it gaining access to that backup will be impossible.. Private app storage is often not accessible from outside the individual app.

What sort of issues is the iPhone 7 having?. Yeah it’s on my iPhone right now! Okay that amazing !! Thanks again. Yeah seems that way, No way to take the data of the app and 'move' it somewhere either??

Does the unit make any sounds? When you plug in a charger, it should make a “chime” type sound and if it’s in a known wifi, then it should try to receive email and make sounds there as well. Try a “force restart” aka “hard reset”. This *may* be a display issue but more info is needed. Displays die on the iPhone X (not XS or XSMax) like crazy. I used to repair them and for some reason, the X just eats displays.

Worst case, it’s a board issue.. Could be shot. i tried hard resetting but it still won't work. it doesn't make any sounds either so i'm not entirely sure what to do... if it's a board issue is there anything i can do?. On the X, not much. The board design is prone to problems. The board is a “sandwich” with the top board about 2-inches long and the bottom board about 3-inches long. It’s the difference in length that is the source of quite a few issues...they like to separate. If it is a board issue, Apple will only offer to replace the whole device and all non-backed up data will be lost. If you have a 3rd party repair shop in your area that can do microsoldering then they should be able to narrow down what’s going on and be able to determine if it’s actually repairable or not. May times it’s cheaper to repair the board than replace it through Apple.

If your documents were backed up through iCloud backup or other means, you should still be able to access them...if not, they forensic data recover is your only option and that can run $200-$300 on the very low end or up to $2100+ for the professionals",323.0,5,93,0

I've been trying all night to set up and activate the new phone, but it won't work. I connected it to my computer, but it kept telling me to connect to a computer even though I already was, or it would say that I am indeed connected to a computer, but do nothing else. 

Many, many times it had me enter in my Apple ID and password, load for a bit, and not do anything. On my computer, in the iTunes app, I located the device on there because it was plugged into the computer, and it also kept having me enter in my Apple ID login info over and over again. I would type my password, it would load, and then take me right back to the login screen. A couple times, it's said that an unexpected response or something like that occurred in the device, but I didn't do anything on it.

329,Question about downsizing iPhone XR,gw9mni,2020-06-04 03:50:05,"Thinking about downsizing...A few questions and advice needed!

I want to downgrade my iphone 10R to a smaller model. This phone is in very good condition.

I used to have the original iphone SE. Could get it for about 150. The new SE seems to be around 400.

I’m essentially wondering how much value I could get out of my current phone if I were to trade it in. It’s in very good condition like I said. Would they give me a straight swap for the new SE? Would I have to pay 100 bucks or so? More than that? 

Like I also mentioned, the SE original is about 150 online. Would it be a mistake (from a financial standpoint) to try and sell my current phone and buy the original SE? I’m trying to get as much value out of this as I can.

This post might be a bit jumbled but if someone could decipher and potentially give me some advice that would be much appreciated.

*Yes the most obvious thing would be to go to the apple or t-mobile store but they’re closed and I can’t get ahold of them via the phone",2,1.0,4.0,"I wanted to find out for you.

I chose the Xr and then I clicked the button that says it's in good condition.

It tells me the trade-in value is $300. So that means you would get the new iPhone SE for $149.00 after they receive your iPhone Xr. So, you'd pay $449.00 up front..

Anyone have any ideas?  

Additional info:  

When I first finished the battery replacement I realized the ribbon cable that connects the charger port and microphone were unplugged.  I plugged them back in and the phone was boot looping.  I then realized that when that ribbon cable was unplugged I could boot the phone all the way up, but obviously the phone wouldn’t charge and I’d have no microphone.  I then found a happy medium where I’d plug the ribbon cable in, but only gently and then I’d have a working phone, until the Taptic Engine went out the next day.   

Is the microphone/charger port that connects to the main board in any way related to the Taptic Engine?

There's way too much anxiety around this. Just enjoy your iPhone.. I’ve had this enabled, but it doesn’t always activate. I’d just like it to charge to 80% always unless I disable the feature manually. 

I haven’t looked at jail breaking it, and would rather avoid it if it’s just for this feature. I’m not terribly anxious about it - just want the battery to last over the long term.. Charging past 80% won't hurt it.

So, it’s probably not hacked. Can you get into your iCloud account at appleid.apple.com or icloud.com? Is 2fa enabled? If your security questions, password, and account data are intact, you should be fine (but change the stuff just to make sure).

Edit: Apple will alert you if somebody attempts to login to your iCloud account. It will show up on all of the devices connected to the internet, and signed into the iCloud account (idr if this relies on 2fa). If you want to see a full list of devices, go into the iCloud settings, and check the device list. Any shenanigans should be listed there.. >Was my password just hacked?

Probably not, Apple was having issues with their iCloud servers earlier, that might have something to do with it.

**However**, a recent bug fix patch was just released (13.5.1) which does patch a security issue with ‘Sign in with Apple’, which would have allowed an attacker to compromise accounts for services that use that method.. Good to know about the server issues. 
I checked for an update and it isn’t available on App Store.. What version of iOS are you running?. 13.4.1. Which is definitely not the most recent update.

How are you checking?. I go to the App Store and first check the list of updates waiting for me at the top right corner. When it wasn’t there I searched by iPhone update and there were no updates listed.. The App Store only updates apps.

Settings -> General -> Software Updates is where you go to check for Operating System updates.

372,Catch-22 logging into iMessage and Apple ID with a new phone.,gv28gv,2020-06-02 06:44:12,"Hi!  I just switched to an iPhone (former Android user), and I've been having some trouble getting the calling and texting functions to work.  Here's the situation - 

**Phone Model:** iPhone SE

**Purchase date:** within the last two weeks; my family ordered them as a group

**Country:** United States

**Nature of purchase:** personal use

**OS:** not sure, probably the most recent one

**The issue:**

I recently switched to iPhone from Android, and did not have an Apple ID until today.  I created one and linked it to my email, but have not been able to link it to my phone number.

iOS appears to have created a Catch-22, where I can't send or receive texts through iMessage, or receive calls on the call function, because I haven't activated my phone number on Apple ID; and I can't activate my Apple ID because doing so requires me to receive either a text message or a call on this phone.

**What caused the issue:**
It just came this way.

**Attempted solutions:**

Unfortunately it seems my wireless charger, that puts out 5 or 10 watts isn't going to fast charge my XS Max. So I was looking into WIRED fast charging (The whole 50% in 30 minutes thing), do I NEED to have a USB-C to Lightning setup to get that? Or is there anyway to have a USB-A to Lightning 18W fast charging? Can't really find a straight answer.

Also, what should I be looking for on a USB adaptor for it to be Fast Wireless Charger compatible?

Banking apps should also do this if developed well.. Here’s some proof for you, mine is exactly the same when I switch out from being in a chat window.

If you have a MacBook you can simply copy the files.  I know this doesn’t apply to you, but for anyone else reading it’s pretty simple on the Mac. Another vote for third-party apps. Keeping such important messages in PDF, in several locations (on Google Drive, locally and on external drive, for example) should be more than enough to keep them safe.

iPhone 8
13.3.1
2017 sometime, Canada
No warranty 



Problem:

• for the past week and a bit, I’ve frequently had calls on my phone and discord cut in and out or sound distant from either end, interchangeably. My battery also, seems to be draining quicker. (My battery is at 88% the capacity as when store purchased)


Replicating:

Making a call or receiving a call by phone or calling app. 
Battery obviously drains itself. (It can be sitting and drain around %5+ within half an hour.)


What I’ve tried:

Sliding the sounds bar up and down, silent mode off, turning off many background apps refreshing, deleting some apps. Problem persists. 


Possible causes:

3 months ago, I purchased some cheap ear buds to use and they seemed to permanently mess up the way it reacts to headphones. It will trigger Siri when putting apple headphones in and it will rapid cycle through music or pause and play as if possessed etc. I no longer use headphones with it. 

Other notes:

As I type this, I noticed when an alarm came on, it displayed the volume button as if I were altering it from the external buttons. 

Body of phone is not hot; app battery consumption looks like what I’d assume it to be. 

I hear back and forths as to whether or not iPhone can contract malware. I use an ad blocker and try my best to stay away from any site I’m unsure of. I regularly clean the safari cache and monitor my network.

Do a restore iphone.  if it says to turn off 'find my' and you can't on the phone, go to icloud.com and remove that device (you just add it back later)

are you sure you're not hitting the vol down on accident? try turning off ""change with buttons"" in sounds and haptics in settings.

if that doesn't help, do a settings > general > 'reset all settings'. iPhone 11 Pro

I just turned that off, hopefully that fixes the low volume issue

430,Iphone 5SE paperclip stuck in sim-tray,gspv8f,2020-05-29 09:41:34,"Hi guys,

I was trying to open my sim-tray earlier with a paperclip... Long story short the clip broke off inside the sim-tray.

I can't get it out. Is this a huge problem? I.e. is there any risk to the internals of the phone?",7,0.89,6.0,"There is a small pin that goes between your device’s housing and the internals, that sits in the SIM eject hole. 

You’ll be fine and should be able to continue to eject the SIM card by using a stronger paper clip, or a stronger SIM eject tool.

In the rare case that you have had your device previously serviced and this pin fell out, and the technician forgot to put it back in, you’ll need to take your device to a repair shop so they can open it and remove the part of the paper clip that is stuck (they should only need to lift the screen up, they shouldn’t need to disconnect anything for this).. I would say it's not a huge risk as there aren't that much moving parts inside the phone. It might eventually block the rotating part of the vibrator, or just get picked up bij the magnet of one of the speakers. The sim-tray is close to the mainboard, so there is a small change it might short something out.  

Free space inside the iPhone is very limited. It depends on the size of the part that broke off to determine if it will be stuck inside the sim-tray or will move inside the phone.

I did repairs on iphones that had had loose parts and screws inside of them, and they all still worked. To be safe, back up your data regularly and maybe get the piece removed by a repairshop.. It cannot block the vibrator. The vibrator wasn’t the old exposed style since the iPhone 4.. There is a small pin that blocks the way, unless the OP had their device serviced and this was removed and the technician forgot to put it back in, it is not possible for it to make its way to the components.. In fact, it is. The iPhone SE (2016) is the last iPhone that was shipped without the taptic engine.. Crap I was wrong. I meant the vibration motor was housed in a [circular housing](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/BWiPpqVA3Lj30rvDB4q8erKdwP1VZF08zMsJAuLuX5SWpZto97lvGdk9VhrtkTXLjGh-CqyCzTZtuaj2Ix9f-tVGmh-O) and I swear I saw it in an iPhone 4 tear down.

I want to buy a new phone but there’s seriously so many options and I really don’t know what to go for.

The XR has same internals as XS and 11 has same internals as 11 pro, just smaller battery, less cameras, and lcd. LCD is very high quality and its literally perfect. 

I say buy a brand new XR(if you can find one) or a Brand new 11. The screen is 6.1 inches(compared to 5.8 and 6.5 inches on 11 pro and max respectively) and has an amazing display. Battery life is very long, and can even last you two days with a battery case. 

I say don’t buy anything 8 plus or below. Not worth it for the money rn. Also, X would be the lowest I would go. Btw, be careful when buying pre-owned or used. Check the IMEI, check the ESN status, and make sure they are paid off. Also, be sure the displays don’t have too much burn in if you are buying a OLED display phone.

The closest alternative to that, that I can think of might be downloading VLC and playing them from there without having to upload the music anywhere..

The files are already on my phone.... iOS was originally designed to work with a synced computer as ‘master’.  Most of Apple’s software can still work this way, they just have Apple Cloud Services support added.. Can’t you copy them back onto your computer?

It’s a red iPhone 11 with 64gb with the box and accessories 
Used for around 5 months with Apple warranty till late December
Price :$570usd 
is it worth it over a $450 iPhone XS gold 64gb with no warranty? 
What’s my best bet?
I have the iPhone 7 32gb rn btw",1,1.0,8.0,"I guess it depends on if you want the better camera system and the much better battery life. Otherwise, the Xs has 3D Touch and an OLED display, if the display is important to you (it's not to me).

I'd rather recommend the used iPhone 11 though since it still has the warranty for 5 months. I don't know whether they're transferable though.. First make sure both devices work well with your carrier. Test the with a sim and insure both function and don't have the sim lock screen come up. Next Ask if both devices are fully paid off and check with the carrier to insure they are paid off. You do not want to purchase a finance device that gets black listed a few months later.  I personally would prefer the XS. It has more premium construction, oled display, and is cheaper. Only improvement I see with the 11 is night mode for the camera, normal day use is very similar. CPU upgrade between the XS and 11 isn't really noticeable during daily use. Both would be fine upgrades for your 7 32gb.. In most places warranty is linked to the device, so it is transferable. But is it worth the risk buying it off someone(iPhone 11)? Xs is in a phone store. How do I check with a carrier if they’re unlocked?. Oh. You sold me on the idea of getting the Xs instead.. What I would do normal is first ask the seller. If he/she is a part of ebay or swappa and says its unlocked it should be fine. (if you get scammed just contact ebay or swappa for a refund) If its a private seller or on some other marketplace like facebook marketplace ask for the imei and what carrier it belong to. Next depending on the carrier there is either a website portal to check if the device is unlockable like at&t or you must contact support like Sprint. I would avoid a device where the seller is vague or unwilling to give you the information as those are huge black flags.. They both are used so I’m not sure what’s my best bet",361.0,3,49,0

Volume keys then lock key reboot does not work).  We set her up a new icloud bound to gmail, airdropped her pictures to an ipad on that account, and now we want to nuke the iphone 8 fresh and put it on the new gmail icloud and then destroy/discard the 5.

I'm aware that I took a massive step back as far as hardware goes, but I still feel like the baseline experience is lackluster and I'm really frustrated. I have a suspicion that hardware isn't the source of my issues and it's more of an iOS problem. Hopefully you can fill me in.

My first complaint is the notifications. I miss shit all the time. It seems like if I don't see a text as it comes in I lose it to the ether. Android has persistent icons in the top bar to indicate notifications. As far as I can tell the only equivalent in iOS is the badges on icons. Am I missing something important?

The second and definitely most annoying is the keyboard. I can't type worth a damn on this thing. It autocorrects words for seemingly no reason. I've tried using gboard to help the transition but it seems to be suffering from the same issue. Is there an OS level problem here? Am I just used to nicer screens?

Almost everyone else in my life is on iPhone so I would like to try to make it work. I'm not opposed to shelling out for a new phone if it will solve my issues. I just saw the free phone as a great chance to try it out.

Did I miss the boat? Should I just go back to where I belong?",0,0.33,4.0,"For notifications that you missed, swipe down from the status bar at the top to see the Notification Center. I think Apple opted for this so that they could have less stuff on the status bar (less clutter, I guess).

To see older notifications while viewing the Notification Center, swipe up from around the middle.

For the auto-correct problem, yeah. I have it disabled. Settings > General > Keyboard.. Text notifications can be set to repeat themselves up to 10 times so you don’t miss them. Also all notifications are grouped together across your lock screen if you have it set up that way. I had an Android system before and didn’t care for the text notification because when you turn the preview off you wouldn’t be able to see who the text was from until you swiped down from the top. 
As far as keyboard I think it could be better in regards to having the numbers there as well instead of touching the number pad to get it and then back again to type letters. You get use to it. But there will always be the debate that Apple sucks and Android rocks vice versa. Don’t go by any forms you read unless their helpful for the task at hand. The ultimate decision will be your preference on what phone and platform works for you. Good luck.. For notifications, the Notification Center shows on the lock screen as well as being able to get to it from (I think) the top (I’ll double check when I get on an older model with a home button).

For typing, it might just be you’re not used to the keyboard... what sort of words are being autocorrected?

Idk for sure if that will help but give it a shot..

* My phone is at like 255.9/256 GB, so it may not have enough storage to even install an update. This sounds dumb, but if there is a way to somehow clear up storage without turning my phone on, that might help (i.e. deleting imessage data via macbook, etc)
* I've now seen several threads where people got their phones to work by smacking them. I am continuing to attempt that.
* I have an apple watch (w/out cellular) connected to the phone, if that can be helpful at all.
* Will legit venmo anyone who helps me figure out a solution without losing my photos/videos. I don't care about anything else.. What ios is it on?. I'm just curious, what prompted you to turn off backup (or never turn it on)?. Error 14 is a bad cable. Try a new Apple genuine cable. 

Also try another computer with newest iTunes.. I can't give you an exact answer without my phone powering on, but I can say it isn't 100% up to date but also has been updated in the last 6 months if I'm guestimating correctly. I'm trying to find out if there's another way to find this info.. I've tried turning it on in the past, but it just overwhelmed my phone and wouldn't even process the request. so here we are.. I used several different genuine cables and the newest iTunes. I read somewhere that error 14 could also be a storage capacity issue, which makes sense. It could be why the update usually starts then stops at about 30%.. If you can get it into DFU mode then plug it into your Mac and open and old version of checkrain and boot it up with that. It boots from the computer not the phone, so it may work.. Which iPhone do you have?. Which version of checkrain is the old version? And would I be able to retain my data if it isn't backed up?. iPhone X - not sure which iOS. You will be able to keep your data, and any version that makes you put the phone into DFU mode before you start the process. Did that work?. That's really strange.. I checked to find checkra1n, but the beta version does not seem to be recommended so I did not go through with it. Based on my current situation, several folks have advised that a jailbreak wouldn't actually solve the main issue. I'm really just trying to figure out if there's any way to recover some of my data (photos/videos) before I wipe it. I did try minitool and 3uTools.

After calling Sprint they confirmed my fear that the device was still financed and that they couldn't unlock it.

Who rinses off a cell phone under water?. Are you saying you'd like to try to fix it yourself? I recommend not doing that and instead taking it to Apple to have them fix it. They will open it up safely and correctly, they will fix it safely and correctly, and they will put it back together safely and correctly. Doing it yourself is risky, especially if you've never done it before.. If you want to fix it yourself, watch some YouTube videos of the process of changing the display. Check out ifixit.com for some good resources. This will give you a good idea of how it works and if you think you would be comfortable doing it yourself.

If you just want the data, is it backed up in iTunes or to iCloud?. If its still vibrating most likely the logic board is still ok and you only fry the screen. Plug it into a computer and do a backup. You now have the option of replacing the screen (Usually around 150-250usd from third party repair shop) or cutting your losses and selling the device.. Wasn't thinking straight, my brain autopiloted to: iPhone Xs are water-resistant so I may be able to run it under water to clean it. I would like to try for myself, as Apple and other iPhone fixers will surely be close during this crisis. I won't try anything drastic without assurance, of course, but  maybe simple things such as a hard reboot, or a way to transfer info. I don't care as much for the phone as to the information inside. I need a way to access this info.. it's backed up to iCloud. I sent it into a shop this morning and when they replaced the screen it worked! However, it is now stuck in a reboot loop. Do you know of a way to help it? The shop said that they didn't know how to cancel the reboot loop and the only way was to reset the entire phone.. Then you can restore your data to a new phone.. The method they are using is putting the device in recovery mode plugging it into a computer and restoring the device. It’s a sure way to stop the bootloop issue.

549,Calendar/contacts disappeared - any way to recover?,gov91x,2020-05-23 00:27:54,"All, thanks in advance for any help;

I’ve got an iPhone 6 with 12.4.4. Purchased in 2014 in the US for personal use. 

As of like midnight last night, everything was fine. When I woke up this morning my calendar (I use the Apple default app) was gone and so were almost all of my contacts. 

Things I’ve looked at:

I am still signed in on the iPhone. 

I checked and all the calendars are clicked to show in the app - just now only the holidays have anything. (The other options besides Holidays are Work and Home; not sure what I used before but it was just whatever the default was.)
Checked iCloud, only to discover that my phone wasn’t backing up to iCloud :(

—-

Things I have not done:

Signed out and back in to my phone (don’t want to lose my safari tabs and I don’t know if they’re part of the backup I did earlier today or if signing out will lost them; concerned that logging out &amp; in will “lock in” the problem). 

There is also my concern that signing out will apparently delete, like everything? I can restore from a backup, but won’t that just leave me in the position I’m in?

Updated to the newest iOS (also concerned that updating will “lock in” the problem)

Restored from iCloud (apparently my phone hasn’t been backing up to iCloud; yay)

—-

Things I’m not sure about:

My most recent backup was from 2/1 - is there any way to restore just the calendar and contacts from that backup, or is it an all or nothing thing?

Thanks again!

ETA: Since this happened, I just tried to add something to my calendar and noticed that it picks “Work” as default. I’m all but positive that wasn’t the case before. Was there something other than “Work” or “Home” that I could have been adding to? The phone also logged me out of Twitter but not any other app I’ve noticed.",1,1.0,5.0,"~~Are you syncing calendars with iCloud?~~

Are you using any sync services?. If you have viber/whatsapp & the likes, some contacts could still be saved.

And if you allowed IG to sync contacts, you may retrieve some contacts also.

Now lesson learned here is you might want to sync your contacts with your google email for future use.. Not that I am aware of. I only have a gmail acct and a hotmail account I use for junk mail - I checked both and nothing from my Calendar app was there. I then deleted and re-added my gmail and Hotmail accounts just in case, and that didn’t change anything. 

In that process I discovered that the only things listed on the Calendar app’s accounts are “icloud” and “other” - the Gmail and Hotmail accounts weren’t even listed before I re-added them. Since I wasn’t syncing to icloud, I feel like I must’ve been adding my calendar appts to something else - but what?. May have been only local then... in which case they are lost.

577,Question about iBeacon,gnovbz,2020-05-21 02:54:28,"Hello everyone and thanks to anyone who can help answer my question

I have a friend coworker who works in the same building as his significant other (different departments). Without going into too much detail, their relationship has broken trust between them and therefore his girlfriend is constantly looking for him in the building. He'll be in some random location within the building working and she'd somehow find him.

I've only just learned about iBeacon (Pixel user here) and the moment I learned about it, I had an 'Aha! ' moment. This is how she must be finding my friend in the building all the time. But having tried YouTube and Google to see if anything comes up about iBeacon stalking, nothing comes up.

My question is rather simple. Is it truly possible for my friend's girlfriend to have set up an iBeacon on his phone without his knowledge, and track him accurately and effectively using her phone?

Thanks again",1,1.0,4.0,"I doubt it.  Does your business have iBeacons installed?

Depending on the infrastructure, she could be using the wifi network or even FindMyiPhone to track him.. Hmmmmm. Seems odd, but the iBeacon thingy on his phone seems somewhat unlikely. Try having him disabling bluetooth, cellular data, and wifi. Removing the sim card is a last resort if she finds him, just for testing. An alternative is putting all electronics in a faraday bag. Nothing gets in, nothing gets out. If she still finds him, idk what to tell you. Maybe she is asking around to see where he is, or she put some kind of physical gps thingy in his stuff. Does the building have signal, and does she have access to his location via a tracking app (like “Find”)?. No beacons installed. I figured she made his iPhone a beacon. But maybe you're right, maybe it is FindMyiPhone. I just don't know if it's accurate enough where she can tell which office in the same hallway he's in.

edit: i’ve turned icloud on and off a few times so maybe that has something to do with it?. If the photos are stored in your iCloud then deleting them will not clear up space on your phone. 

You should do a backup of your phone, restore it in recovery mode to factory, and then restore your backup. Usually helps with that issue.. Shoot. I don’t know. I finally had to offload some photos because they were taking do much space. I did realize I had been taking my photos with the Live feature and it took a ton of space.. Why wait?. Yes.  When you initially turn iCloud Photos on (or on again), the iOS will compare what is already on the phone and on iCloud (to keep from having duplicates).  It is common to see fluctuation in the amount of storage being used by Photos and System until the sync has completed.  And, if you don't have the space needed on iCloud for the syncing, it will stay in limbo.. If you select the option for ""Optimize iPhone Storage"", a smaller device size copy of the images is made to keep on the phone, so it does take bit extra local phone storage until the first syncing is complete.

50 GB of iCloud storage is just $0.99 per month.  I learned the hard way, sadly, that having my photos backed up is worth 99 cents a month.. i was driving and need to download imgur but gotta clear up some space before i can download imgur lmao. If it’s as bad as a think it is, you may not be able to if you don’t already have it installed.

In that case, you can take a photo with another device and use that.. [here’s a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/uR0DSY1) 

Note: Even though it says I have about 21GB free on here, it keeps telling me my iphone storage is full. But this is because yesterday I turned on icloud storage to reduce file sizes. Before i did this, “system” was the same but “photos” took up the other 20-ish gigabytes (which i believe it still is doing, it just doesn’t say because they’re supposed to be in my icloud. 

I only have about 6-7000 photos at the moment, before “system” took up all this space my phone could hold about 12,000 photos. It seems that the more i delete photos, the more “system” takes up, so I’m afraid it might be corrupted data or corrupt storage (from filling it up and deleting over and over so many times). How much iCloud storage do you have?. only 5 GB, that’s why it won’t complete the backup. but before i turned on icloud storage, system already took up all that space. Worse.  iCloud Photo Library will continue to eat up local storage as you try to clear things up.

Best bet is to pay for enough iCloud storage to hold your current photo library and allow the sync to complete.. thank you! i might try to cancel the backup if it lets me clear up 5 GB. i wonder if all the “system” storage was because of last time i had icloud turned on, so i might just end up where i started. You’re not the first to have this issue.

Basically, if you don’t have enough iCloud storage to hold your photo library, don’t enable iCloud Photo Library.

People have lost data due to this.

iOS is to busy trying to fit your ‘20-ish’ GB photo library into the 5Gb iCloud storage you get for free... it’s never gonna work.. i think it will let me stop the process right now, but it has to delete 1,300 photos in order to do so, is there any way to see which photos will be deleted before i do it?. From memory, no.

There is a hardware issue where the iPhone pretty much constantly receives input as if the top button is being pressed, even when it isn't and the 'click' of the power button appears to be working fine. In my searches it seems [this](https://smile.amazon.com/s?k=iPhone+SE+Power+and+Volume+Buttons+Flex+Cable&rh=p_85%3A2470955011&dc&qid=1589943712&rnid=2470954011&ref=sr_nr_p_85_1) needs to be replaced, which seems to be a highly challenging/technical hardware fix. I am hesitant to attempt it, but may one day

However, I bought this phone second-hand simply for using while exercising due to its convenient size. So it will be powered down 97% of the time and I can manage with the screen being on the whole time the other 3%.

What is highly inconvenient is that even while powered down, when the phone receives input that the top button is being pressed, the screen flashes on with the apple logo on for \~5 seconds/off \~5 seconds. This drains the battery pretty quickly even though it's powered down.

Is there any way to stop this from happening? I'd hate to have to keep it charging every moment it isn't in use or else have the battery sit idle, totally drained.",2,1.0,5.0,"Don't try this repair. It will ruin you. Take it to a shop and have a pro do it instead. It's a solid little phone and worth saving.. The top button?

If works for all other functions you’re probably stuck with that hardware repair.

It’s draining the battery because it’s actually trying to boot.. Does it seem like I'm on the right track that this is the necessary repair? Any idea what this will typically cost? Edit: Also any idea if these shops are typically even open during quarantine?

When I wake the screen I always immediately get the ""swipe to power down"" screen, and when I decline it goes away until I hit the top button again. Hitting the home button sometimes takes a screenshot. The top button will not sleep the screen because it always immediately wakes back up (though inactivity will permit the screen to sleep).. Not too expensive but each shop charges on their own criteria. Sounds like the power button is constantly pressed or is shorting out. Changing the power/volume flex should fix it unless it's a board level issue. Has it gotten wet at all?. No idea, I bought it second-hand this way. I got it cheap and only plan to use it as a workout device so it doesn't have to be perfect, but at the same time I don't want the battery draining even in a powered down state.

597,iPhone not sending audio during phone calls,gn2tst,2020-05-20 02:22:59,"Hi everyone, first time here so any help is appreciated. Here's hoping I give you all the info you need on the first go.

- iPhone model and iOS version

iPhone 8 64GB Grey, iOS 13.4.1

- Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

I'm almost certain the phone is no longer under warranty, and if the problem is so dire that it would require repair/replacement beyond what I am able to do myself, I'll just buy a new one. So I wouldn't dwell on this.

- What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

The issue is as follows; when using the Phone app to make a call, I can hear whoever I am calling just fine, but they are unable to hear me. They are able to hear me when I plug in headphones, or use the speaker phone, but not when I hold the phone to my ear. The problem started yesterday and has been replicated on every call I've made since, regardless of the app used. (e.g. Facebook Messenger).

- What caused the issue?

Unknown.

- What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

I have tested the microphone in the voice memo's app and it picks up sound fine. I reset the network settings on the phone as well as the general settings. I did a soft reset on the phone. I've turned off Bluetooth. I have cleaned the lightning port to the best of my ability. I have turned off noise canceling in accessibility.

- Any other information you think might be useful.

The problem seemed to spring up out of no where. I haven't made any software updates or anything that might have acted as a catalyst I don't think. The strangest thing to me is that the headphones and speaker phone will both transmit audio, but not the standard mic. Furthermore, it's strange to me that the standard mic can detect sound in the voice memos app, but will not send it out over any kind of call.

Thanks very much, any help is appreciated. I'll be monitoring this closely and trying anything suggested.

UPDATE: I'm still testing things. When I rub my thumb over the bottom microphone in a call, the person on the other end can hear it.",2,1.0,1.0,"Probably a hardware issue.

The one on the back can be ruled out. Idk how the source mics are chosen, but whichever one you blew into is the one with the trouble. The only reason people can hear you on speaker is bc of the audio source being switched. Maybe there is water or dust in it.

I already got everything backed up and transferred to the new phone, but I want to completely wipe the old one before I send it back. I was able to factory reset it through iTunes, but i’d like to do more. Any software that I’ve downloaded to try and wipe the phone requires you to buy a license to actually use the feature. I only want to do this once, so I don’t want to spend the money on it. Does anyone know a program that does it for free, or do I not even need to do this in the first place?",8,1.0,9.0,"Nope, you do not need another software to perform the wipe; factory reset deleting all apps and data is sufficient. Also, doubt there's actually a software that allows you to access the root files to perform a wipe unless you're able to jailbreak it first? I may be wrong.. Do a DFU restore.. And be sure that you unpair any Apple Watches before you factory reset the phone. I had that problem with my iPhone 8. I forgot to unpair my Series 3 and had to restore my iPhone 8 just to unpair my Watch. I'm using the new SE now with the Series 5 40mm Space Grey Aluminum.

You want to remove the iPhone from your [Apple ID](appleid.apple.com) , and turn Find My iPhone off for it (in the Find My app on another device signed in to that Apple ID).. Third for iOS reinstall in DFU mode if you are overparanoid (DFU, not Recovery!!!). In other cases factory reset is more than enough, if you're not a celebrity or US senate member ;). DFU mode treats the onboard storage as blank (since it doesn’t understand encryption).  So installing a new iOS image effectively renders the old data irretrievable.. Does it make all of the files unrecoverable though? It probably doesn’t matter though, because I’m just sending it back to my provider. If I was selling it I’d be more worried. Thanks for your help though. I’m almost sure that it won’t be recoverable. Apple is very good at making iPhones encrypted and safe, so I think it will be very hard to recover old deleted data.

639,iPhone 8 [13.1.1] : Messages defaulting to iMessage for Android SMS recipient.,glg4x1,2020-05-17 14:18:47,"Thanks in advance for anyone that can help.

The recipient has a Mac with usage of the iMessage platform and an Android phone.
The messages tend to default to iMessage despite the selected phone number being Android.

If I have sent an iMessage to the recipient earlier in the day and then I want to send a text message, even though I select the mobile number (rather than the associated iMessage email address) it defaults to blue text in the ‘To’ section.

Even if I go ‘new message’ and type in the Android phone number manually, it still defaults to blue. Copy and pasting makes no difference either. 

If I hard press and ‘forward’ the message after it defaults to iMessage, it’s usually the same issue. I don’t think I’ve seen a ‘send as SMS’ option pop up. 

If I go to the contacts and find the person, go ‘message’ and then ‘mobile’ or select their number, it will still set the ‘To’ text to blue/iMessage.

Even if they SMS me, and I try to reply straight back, it will tend to default to whatever I had used to message THEM last, and if it’s an iMessage to their Mac, it almost creates a cycle. I hope that makes sense?

It’s been doing this for some time, and is variable/intermittent with no pattern, despite undertaking the last few iOS update, restarting the phone, restating the messages app and turning iMessages on and off. 

Is anyone else struggling with this? I suppose it’s probably something technical, but it can be really irritating if you’re trying to contact someone with something important and they don’t see the message straight away, because it will be sitting in their email inbox instead, if their Mac isn’t open!

Side note: I feel like I can still select numbers fine through my Mac, so I hope it’s not some weird communication issue between my iPhone and Mac. I have got messages synced with iCloud too, if that would be make any difference to the issue.

I used to use my USB to connect my iPhone to my pc and then copy and paste whatever photos I wanted. For whatever reason it’s not working now. I did everything as I used to but most of my photos were not visible, I could only see a few and they were not in the order I took them. I’m at a loss and have no idea what to do.

They are in more than one folder now. Just look at the root of the iPhone drive.. Sounds like iCloud Photo Library with optimize phone storage is turned on. This removes the photo from the phone so the computer can’t see it to transfer. 

Go to settings > your name > iCloud > photos and check if iCloud Photo Library is on and if optimize is checked. If so, go to iCloud.com on the computer and download them from the cloud.... easier in the long run, since if that option is checked you most likely have more photo/video data stored in the cloud than you have hard drive space on the phone.. I had the same problem on my 8 plus. I did everything and nothing worked, at last I downloaded google photos on both my phone and pc and backed up my pictures onto my phone and later downloaded them on my PC.. Oh no, that sucks. I would do that but I have thousands at this point :/. I tried but it made no difference :(. Thank you!. It’s currently off, I don’t remember if it always like that. I tried going to iCloud.com but it doesn’t give me the option to download photos, I can look at my notes and contacts though. Thank you for your answer!. That’s what I’m trying to do now!!, it just takes forever because there’s more than 10 000 and I feel it stops backing the up if I minimize the app so I would be open to other options. Hopefully it works out.
Thanks so much!. Ok then you'll have to use iCloud for Windows. That's what I use because I grew tired of the increased difficulty of getting my photos and videos off my iPhone manually using Windows Explorer.. If you can see some photos, but not others it means the photos aren’t on the HD of the phone anymore for the computer to see. If you go to icloud.com on your computer and sign in, do you see your photos?

iCloud is the only program that can remove the photos from the HD of the phone to the best of my knowledge. I left it overnight I had like 7k photos, and i took about 20gbs out of mu internet.. I’d you don’t mind me asking, did you have any issues logging into the iCloud for windows?. I can’t seem to do it. 
I see, I could’t log into the iCloud app for Windows and if I go to the website, it doesn’t show me pictures at all. Thanks for the info!. No.. Does it say loading photos, or that there are no photos?

Do you see the photos you are wanting to transfer to the computer on the camera roll?

The water pressure from the faucet can physically misplace the internals. Treat water resistance as a safety net. It's only meant to protect against splashes and a quick submerge in shallow water..

Edit: if you don’t have a current backup, make sure to do that first.. Wow, I had no idea faucet pressure could do such a thing. Noted!

That definitely sounds like a great policy — treat water resistance as a safety net, and don’t actively test your device against water (although I was really just trying to clean my device in worry that it got contaminated by COVID-19 while out shopping). Regardless, I took a risk (didn’t want to clean the alcohol odour off my hands after such an approach, and I was already right at the sink where there was conveniently soap and water 😬) and it looks like it went badly. I’m hoping it comes around though. So far I’ve waited around 18 hours for any remaining liquid to evaporate (although I’ve been using my device during that time and it wasn’t completely turned off and left alone), and the haptic feedback/vibration still hasn’t returned. Audio is just fine though.

Thank you for all your input.. I really hope it dries out. I was puzzled though — isn’t iPhone 7 water resistant? If so, why does that page say getting moisture in its openings is a really bad thing?. Because water resistant doesn't equal water proof.. No, it isn’t.

Water resistance tends to fade with age and use on models that are water resistant.. Well, I wasn’t really expecting waterproofing (it was just pouring tap water and not submersion). I was just hoping water resistance could mitigate my situation. I mean it’s not like I had the phone completely submerged in a liquid.

At the same time, I do understand it’s better not to have the device in contact with water in any case, if given the choice. I’d just taken a risk out of convenience, since I’d already been at a sink in my bathroom where there was soap and water right nearby. I’d figured IP67 should mean it wouldn’t be that bad, and I guess it didn’t work out. I’m still waiting and hoping though (albeit in the dark for now).

Thanks for your post!. Yeah, the seal fades over time, and a lot of times if you’ve ever had work done to a phone the water resistance is destroyed in the process of opening the device.. Well, I hope I lucked out in that case. I did have its battery replaced in Oct. 2018 (at the Apple store), and I hope when resealing the phone Apple had renewed the seals. 🤞🏻. But wouldn’t new sealing be applied by Apple when they’re closing the device? I actually had my battery replaced in Oct. 2018 at the Apple store.. That was a while ago.

Even if it turns back on, make sure to keep up to date backups as water damage can take a while before it actually affects anything.. That was a year and a half ago... more than enough time for the new seals to wear out again.. Didn’t know that! You mean it could actually stop working completely in like, say, 1.5 weeks from now? Sounds like a backup would be a smart thing to do.. And oddly enough, I had Apple support conduct a diagnostics test on my device via the app. They said the test results showed nothing was wrong internally with my device. I’m not really sure if that matters towards anything though.. Ah, I see. Well, I guess this just has to be waited out.. Could be a few days, could be never 🤷🏻‍♂️. Not at all.

Not much you can do without opening it up.. Shut down your iPhone. Don't do any of this until it is completely powered off.

Fold up a paper towel into a tiny square, soak it with water, squeeze out some of the water but not all of it. Maybe leave about half the amount of water in it. You want this little square to be like a soaked sponge that is holding water but not dripping wet.

Orient your iPhone so that volume buttons are on top.

Now, use this paper towel ""sponge"" to squeeze out the remaining water over the buttons repeatedly by pressing the paper towel square ""sponge"" against the buttons.. You're rinsing out whatever has made the button become sticky/mushy. It's ok to press the buttons with the paper towel. In fact, I recommend it.

Do not run the iPhone under water as an alternative way to do this. I repeat: do not do it. This paper towel method is far safer. Yes, it's still risky, but if your Xr has no defects, the water you repeatedly squeeze out shouldn't go inside.

Do this a few times. By that, I mean, get more water into your little paper towel ""sponge"", squeeze maybe half of it out and then press it against the buttons again to try to rinse out whatever is in there.

When you've done it maybe 2-3 times altogether, you should use a dry paper towel to press the buttons and you should blow very hard around the entire circumference of the buttons to further help get the water out of there.

Now, test the buttons. If they are both clicky again, you may turn the iPhone back on. If this didn't solve the problem at all, then, well of course you can turn the iPhone back on but I would take it to an Apple store and have them look at it.

I have an iPhone 11 and I had a lemonade spill near my iPhone and some of it splashed against the Sleep/Wake button. A few hours later, my Sleep/Wake button lost its clicky feel and sound and it would stick as well. I did exactly as I described above and it restored it 100%.. Damn. That’s a bummer. It’s so annoying that it’s not clicking.",385.0,4,70,0

Search imie on there and see if Find my Iphone On or Off.. i bought the phone off of ebay. i did that but not sure if its correct because of the no service issue. Oh I see. You check sickw.com ok.

Best resell get some money back.. i recently had it unlocked from at&t, the problem that i have is that i dont know if the icloud lock status has updated since because the person sold their phone after it had no service issue (i think). Well, carrier lock and iCloud lock is two different thing. iCloud has nothing do with your carrier/cellular service.. ill summarise it, the phone has the baseband power management failure (no service) and it cannot activate and when you search the imei it will say find my iphone is on, is it possible that the person could have removed their icloud but it didnt update that on the iemi database because it couldnt connect to them becasue of the no cellular. Oh right. Well, iCloud status checking is online and with apples server directly. So it doesn’t need the phone to connect to have the iCloud updated. Hope this explains.. but the phone probably cant connect to apple servers. Yes that’s true. But you can remove iCloud from iCloud.com itself without even need of the phone.. yeah but for that to actually sync through to the phone it physically cant.

Today I pulled up safari and went to type in a web address that began with the letter “S.”  The keyboard froze and so did safari. No big, kill the app and reopen. It’s still stuck on the same page. Kill it a second time and relaunch. It reverts back to the last page I was on. Go to type in the address again and it locks up. Every time I type in “S” as the starting letter it locks and I have to close and open, close and open. 

Did the simple stuff like reboot the phone, and went into web data and started deleting any sites starting with “S” that had any actual data next to it (as opposed to 0.0mb). 

I can type every other letter of the alphabet except for “S”. I’m not sure when this started because the last few days I’ve most stuck to my favorites. 

I’m sure the simplest answer is to clear history and web data. But I’d like to avoid that. 

I can, however, start with “www.s” and get to the site. Also, I’ve got no issues starting with S in my Firefox browser.

You don’t usually need a profile to install an app.

What app was this?. the kind that's actually a website link, or a bookmark as iOS itself seems to call it. It was ""installed"" off Safari.. If you’ve already done long press -> delete bookmark, try rebooting.

I’m confused about this profile you’re talking about though.. I already did reboot several times. What usually happens if delete bookmark doesn’t show up, which is what happened, is to go into Settings -> General -> Profiles to either verify or remove certain developers and their apps.

705,iPhone 11 Pro dead,giki49,2020-05-12 21:10:51,"So my mom dropped her iPhone 11 one to many times.... now the phone only powers on but can’t be unlocked or backed up to a computer. The LCD screen shows a display but has zero function.  She wants to keep all of the information and transfer it to a new iPhone via iCloud but I can’t grant access to my computer via the phone because it needs to be unlocked, also Apple doesn’t offer an option to backup a phone online via iCloud. 

I’ve called Apple, local places around that fix phones, and our service provider. They all have given me the same answer “we can get you a new phone” or “we can’t repair it”. I’m wondering if anyone else has ran into this problem and if so what did you do to either fix the phone, transfer the data, or back up the information to put it onto a new phone. Thanks!",1,1.0,14.0,"When you say the screen “shows a display but has zero function”, what does that mean? You can see the full image on the screen but can’t interact with it? Or you can’t see anything but garbage on the screen but at least it lights up? How do you know the phone is working otherwise, if you call the number does it ring?

If the phone is actually functional except for the screen, you may have some options. If the touchscreen is working at all, you can try to type in the passcode blind by sort of guessing where the numbers are. This might get you to be able to back it up with itunes. Another potential option is using a USB keyboard via an adapter to type in the passcode.. Let me clarify: 
1. “Shows a display but has zero function” meaning I can see the full image on the screen but can’t interact with it. 

2. When I call the phone it does ring, but other than that the touch screen is completely unresponsive.

If I used an adapter for lightning cable to USB and connected a USB keyboard, if I pressed enter could that potentially prompt the passcode entry on the screen? Allowing me to type in the code unlocking the phone? 

With a fully functioning phone, except screen, is it possible to repair the screen? Everyone I called doesn’t have the parts.. That is recommended, and also the getting a mouse connected too.. Okay, thank you! I will try that. Also, if you have a Windows computer you can use 3uTools to transfer all of the data over to the new iPhone.. Okay I do, I’ll look into that tonight. You will have to trust the computer though, but 3uTools might be able to recognize it anyways.. Alright so I may be able to skip the “trust this computer” step if the software identifies it?. Maybe, but it’s still recommended to try using a mouse and keyboard if possible to get into the iPhone and trust the computer.. If you have plugged the iPhone into the computer in question before and you already trusted it it will work.. Alright I’ll try that first. Thank you! I find it funny that not one of these places I called recommended trying this smh. Oh okay, unfortunately this is the first time it will ever be plugged into a computer, my mother has no access to one.

Guess it’s pretty much start a new for ya.. Is there anyway you can start with your original Apple ID and change it after transfer? 

You will have to enter your old apple ID while they are transfering, for security reasons. This also applies to wallets/private things. Other than that, the rest of your apps, history and downloads will transfer. After the transfer is complete you can change your apple ID.. This happens before you have the option to use a new ID. And it will log in to the old iD. You can then log out and log in to the new ID. 

Have you forgotten the credentials for the old ID?  Why are you so hesitant to use it, if only temporarily?. Thank you! It will be someone else doing the transfer. So could they do the transfer with all the apps/history/etc. and then change the Apple ID and install anything new that they want? Would that delete anything?. It's not hesitance per se - essentially, I'll be given the new phone with a new Apple ID already pre-loaded.. I don't think it would delete anything, except some of the data on the apps, which would not work anyway on a new apple ID.  As long as you know your old apple ID it should be good..

The only reason I say that is because it sounds like the display isn’t communicating properly with the device. I just wanna set up proper expectations for them because I can’t guarantee that this well worth, y’know?. It sounds like the digitizer layer got damaged and was “ghost touching” which kicked him out before the screen was replaced. Now the screen is working but won’t connect to iTunes as it is. That’s what his question was about. 

Recovery mode to update is pretty much his option and hope it doesn’t force him to restore.. If it’s disabled I don’t think an update will resolve the issue.. Connecting to iTunes in restore mode and updating can certainly kick it out of the permanently disabled mode. I did it to an iPhone 7+ earlier today. It will force it back to the iPhone is disabled for 60 minutes screen and after the countdown you can get back in.. Hey could you help me out please? I would greatly appreciate it, dealing with a very similar situation! Let me know, thank you. I have an iPhone SE that is ‘disabled - connect to iTunes’ how do I get it to update via iTunes on a computer which it was previously synced with (not a very recent backup) which is why I don’t want to restore. The one problem I am encountering is getting it to update when connected to iTunes. Any feedback or help would definitely be very much appreciated. Thank you :). Is iTunes recognizing the phone? Has it tried to update but given you an error?. It recognizes the iPhone when I put hold home&power then release power during load up screen. Then when I click update instead of restore to prevent from losing data it doesn’t move past “contacting iPhone update server”. Thanks for the reply, much appreciated. No error was given but it seems to be stuck during update, any advice?. Not really, if it’s getting stuck on a particular part of the update cycle, I usually tell the people to contact Apple or try the restore if they have backed up recently.. Would you happen to know if it has anything to do with ‘Find My iPhone’ being enabled on the device?. It shouldn’t. Whether FMI is on or off, the phone still needs to check with the server to view the status.. Last question, is it possible to fix by putting the device into lost mode via iCloud? Will I be able to turn lost mode off and does having an active sim card in the device influence the update status? Thank you for getting back to me. Follow up?",557.0,8,165,0

For this to make more sense we need to understand a little fundamental about how iOS works.
Each app is in its own sandbox. This is every app, like even the system apps like Photos and Music. No app can have access unless it is done through the system or explicitly permitted. Even as far as I know, the Files app is it’s own sandbox.
Now, iTunes (or any app like AnyTrans that is able to pretend to be iTunes) has access to a few of these sandboxes, like Photos, contacts, Music, etc. So the way you can add music to your phone is through those programs. They will not reside in your files, they will reside in Music’s sandbox.
You can use iTunes or an alternative.
The way “music player” apps get access to that music is that they prompt you to allow them to communicate with Music’s sandbox.
Hope this made a few things more clear.. I use the Music app.

Add MP3 to the Music app on Mac

Sync music library to iPhone.. Like something to manage all my mp3 files on my phone, instead of using just, “Files.”. The whole security and architecture of iOS is quite stunning and robust. I never really considered the whole sandboxing thing, but now when I think about it (in this context), my brain works. It does make sense, and thank you! I’ll use the right methods to get the files in the right place.. Can it be done on windows?. Sure, using iTunes.

Current issues are:

Charging very slowly, the charging port also doesn’t stay connected as in it’s always in but goes on and off charge. This has only recently happened - it was great when I bought it. 

I also sometimes get messages saying “this accessory isn’t supported” - I am using the original cable that comes with the iPhone - I have tried others and the problem is still there. 

Same when it’s connected to a computer and I tried to download my pictures off the phone to my PC - it kept disconnecting and if it was connected I’d get an error half way through the download saying “ device unresponsive”.

Lastly I have a constant message on my iPhone saying “update Apple ID Settings - some account services will not be available until you sign in again” but I am already signed in? And when I type in my password again it just loads the page saying “updating iCloud” for hours and never does anything.

Basically, you have the built in audio controls (in the control center, lock screen, or using buttons on headphones). Tehse all work fine, but for some reason when i'm listening to music in spotify (which is 99% of the time), those controls will sometimes just go away.

*XS on 13.3.1*

**2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase**

USA on the date it was released from best buy for personal use

**3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?**

I noticed trying to back out of an app in the top left of the screen it wasn't registering touch. then it just started spazzing out like i was scrolling or touching everywhere. It eventually chilled out after sleeping it and waking it. But every couple of minutes it tweaks out again really crazy. when I try to text someone it scrolls up in their convo up and up. Someone sent me a message on IG and just trying to unlock the phone it opened the message and then started typing random shit and emojis. 

**4. What caused the issue?**

seemingly nothing. I have not dropped it or got water on it. It pretty much just sits on my couch next to me during all this. I live alone so its not like I have a kid that messed with it and isn't telling me. 

**5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?**

I cleaned off the screen. then tried holding side button to turn off, which was hard because the upper area of the screen doesn't always sense touch so I couldn't swipe it to turn off. then I did the vol up vol down side button hold to reboot. 

**6. Any other information you think might be useful.**

Doesn’t it also depends if the app supports the iOS version?. let me rephrase it 

at what point will apple not allow me to access the store because my ios version is too old ?. Lowest device I have iOS iOS 4 which lets me last I checked. I resell iPhones. But is pretty sure it’s because I have had apps downloaded before. So if you never downloaded apps at the time of iOS 4 or 6 etc etc then they prob won’t. Any iPhone that supports downloading apps will always support downloading apps, as for what iphone model first provided access to the App Store, I’m pretty sure it was the iphone 3rd gen.  the problem isn’t with what model of iPhone supports downloading apps, itcomes in with whether or not the apps support the software and hardware version of your iPhone. App developers are who dictate what apps are available in the store, what devices those apps support, and what software those apps will work on. It’s why there are some apps that are available on the iPhone that aren’t available on the iPad even if they run the same up to date iOS version.. so the 3rd gen iphone to this day has the ability to search the app store ?

another question .most apps on android target android 4.4.4 .

on IOS what is generally the most targeted version ?. Latest ofc. Some apps do have latest compatible version available for the last compatible iOS version on the device, but not all of them.. I would assume the third version supports the App Store, I didn’t get into iPhones until the 4th gen.... as for which apps work with which versions.... there really isn’t a way to determine that.... it’s all app developer specific. One app development company may have multiple apps that do different things, and because those apps do different things, hardware and security feature  requirements may be different, so dictates which version of iOS is supported.

For example, an app that supports a form of payment method would have different security requirements than say a game application. So the game application MAY be able to be run on a lower software/device version than the payment application, even though they are created by the same developer. 

It also comes down to who the app was written for. Devices get replaced and upgraded, so you see far more iPhone 8’s than you do iPhone 5’s. Would you spend money supporting a device/software that is only used by a small fraction of users, or would you concentrate on devises/software that has a larger user base? If you make money supporting the larger user base, but loose money on the smaller user base, it becomes an easy choice for the developers.",476.0,16,16,0

This may be easier than call forwarding. If both phones are iPhones you can sync call history. On your personal phone go to settings>phone>call forwarding. I’ve never used it, but I assume the feature works like it should. It might be carrier dependent. Test it out and report back. 

For messages you’ve got two things going on. I’m not sure about regular SMS messages and how they can be forwarded. But for iMessages (iPhone to iPhone) they can be received easily by having both numbers associated with your iCloud account. Go to settings>messages>send and receive and check both numbers.. Maybe using google voice with call forwarding?. Ummm you can actually have them linked up and say if phone

If they're both iPhones, and your personal/work numbers are on carriers that allow WiFi calling, then you should be able to have both numbers sync up on both phones,  by signing into your iCloud account on both.

I’m a student and recently got the new SE after saving up for a while and I absolutely love it so far. The only problem I’ve been having (and it seems to be a common problem) is that all the screen protectors that I’ve bought and tried that say they will fit the iPhone 8 / new SE leave huge air bubbles along the sides of the phone. I’m guessing that the SE screen must be more curved than the 8? Either way, it’s a really annoying problem and I can’t bear to use a protector with the big bubbles on the sides. 

I’m wondering whether I should just give up and not bother with a screen protector, or whether I should just keep trying different protectors until I find one that fits. Has anyone managed to find one so far that doesn’t leave these air bubbles? If not, would it be reasonably safe to just put a bumper case on the phone and keep it in a phone pouch or sock or something when putting it in my bag? I am worried about breaking the screen since like I said, I’m a student and funds are tight.

My old phone has tons of photos of our deceased dogs so it’s really important I do this correctly. Thank you!. No problem, pics and videos are impossible to get back without a backup.... just make sure it’s all on your new phone before erasing anything. Compare the total photos of both.. Interesting, so my old phone has 3,294 photos and 43 videos.

&#x200B;

My new SE only has 506 photos and 13 videos. Is there an easy way to carry every single photo over to the new phone?

I'm pretty sure most of the photos are saved on my computer and backup drive, but I also want them on the new phone just in case.. iCloud Photo Library is easiest, but will take time, and space.

I've tried to open it in photos and a variety of Mac apps (like VLC and Handbrake), but either I only get audio with no picture or some variation of an error message that the file can't be opened.

Has anyone else experienced this?

This isn't alwasy the case, though - sometimes I am able to record playable videos with the front camera in landscape mode.  (I just provide this info in case it's helpful.

I wanted to save my data though, I don’t want to lose everything. I don’t know what to do.
Do you think there’s some way to remove the jailbreak even though it’s in a boot loop? that way it can actually turn on properly afterwards. Checkrain will not wipe it if you can do that, and there may be another untethered jailbreak for 13.4.1 (there’s an exploit that was found) and if you didn’t want it booted jailbroken, you could just use a verbose boot that was released before the full checkrain was. Other than that I’m out of ideas. So I can jailbreak it even though it’s in a boot loop? Or what do you mean. It’s still on ios9. Well things can’t really get worse from a boot loop, so I would still try checkrain even tho it’s made for iOS 13 because it boots it through a different exploit, not Apples way or however your current jailbreak boots it. As long as it can enter DFU mode you should be ok. And if you verbose boot it will not boot jailbroken(technically it is but you can’t install cydia). Ok thank you, I’ll try it. Is there a link I can get checkrain from? 
& how do I verbose boot, is there a video on YouTube maybe?. Hey, you know how it was in a boot loop, well now it just goes to the recovery screen?(where it says to plug to iTunes) after 5 seconds. That’s worse than being in the boot loop right?. Glad you asked, there are many fake cites to get u to download malware; the real cite is [checkra.in](checkra.in) and yes there are videos on YouTube for all of it. I don’t remember where I got the verbose boot files from but it’s all on youtube(search up something around the lines of “checkm8/checkrain verbose boot exploit”). You are in recovery mode, hold down power button to get it out, then try and enter DFU mode again. Thanks for the help. One more question sorry. So do I need to verbose boot to jailbreak with checkrain?  or is that just a separate thing that does something else?. The verbose boot was release before they had a finalized jailbreak ready for release. It was put out for testing and development purposes. And no the verbose boot thing uses the same exploit, but jailbreaking you use the application, verbose boot it’s a file and you use the terminal. So I found a guide on YouTube for checkrain by iCU, I got to the part where I need to boot it from my usb, but it says ‘blocked by current security policy’. Is that the firewall? Or something else. Because i turned them off but it still didn’t work.. Are you on OS X?. I’m using windows. Omg sorry, you’re using rainusb correct?. It’s ok haha, the program is called bootrain I think. Can you enable booting from USB in your bios? I don’t use windows on a laptop so I don’t know how. On a desktop you can see what all is plugged in and bootable + the base OS on the hard drive/ssd.

Syncing EVERYTHING should not be the only option, especially if I have thousands upon thousands of pictures and videos on my phone (for having the largest size available, FOR video recording...)

I appreciate the option and I may have to cave for it, But as of now, I am deeply considering switching back to android..ive had apple since it was released on AT&T only...I've supported their shit for so long and it was even easier back then to get videos and pictures off...

...But the fact that I now have to jump through completely unnecessary hoops, or buy people's software just to do what a phone should simply do out of the box, is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous.

Hope youre listening apple. (i know they aren't). If I only wanted one, I would airdrop it.

If you can’t, you could upload to Dropbox or similar and download on computer.. Came from Nexus and I do feel your pain... Managing files if you don't rely on the cloud is a real pain, they definitely should do it more easy and stop forcing people to use iCloud.

About switching to Android, for me it was more a security update (couldn't wait for Ubuntu Mobile for another 100 years :D ), so using a third-party manager was an option as long as it doesn't require jailbreak and won't violate sandbox. I got iMazing while it was with a \~50% discount for like $20, but actually would pay the full price now without any questions. It gives similar options as on Android in terms of file management, but you still have same security level.. I have a PC...airdrop aint really a thing for me. And if im doing 1080p or 4k video, thats a huge file to send wirelessly...

So in that sense, ANY free cloud based stuff is a no-go.

Why in the absolute SHIT in this so damn hard to do for a windows PC to take a damn video file?

I had a method work previously that I thought I saved from about a year ago i posted, asking for help, but i dunno how to search my history.. > Managing files if you don't rely on the cloud is a real pain, they definitely should do it more easy and stop forcing people to use iCloud.

Its not so much getting them to not use the cloud for everything, I like the idea of sharing stuff between my devices. Honestly, between that and the icloud email addresses, is the only reason I continue to use my iphone...and facetime and walkie talkie on the apple watch.

The big thing that i dont like is that simple fact that when you take pictures or videos, you have to go through holy hell in order to get any of them on your computer at all...and the issue with transferring any of them to icloud then bringing them to your computer that way, causes you to lose a bit of the resolution and stuff...cause like, they advertise good lookin pictures and videos, but if you do THAT, it loses something...

Plus, who the hell wants to sit there for hours (maybe) to download a very large, or multi part 4k video, and risk some kinda transfer issue happening and losing some or all of it during the download?

Not I. Though i suppose the same can be said for a physical transfer as well, but at least then, speeds are a lot faster and less room for error.. Whatever the Windows equivalent of Image Capture then?. Used wrong words I guess. Meant that iCloud is a good solution in most cases, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't maintain local transfer and never update it. I understand that Macs have AirDrop and Image Capture is still alive (at least partially), but what the hell should I do if I need to work with Windows/Linux or just don't want to use a Mac? They basically don't leave any choice if you don't want to spend a lot of time to make it work. Best example -- change backup location. It should take like 30 min to implement the custom path, 2-3 blocks of code, but you need to tinker with symlinks... What exactly should I do by their design if I have a 128GB typewriter and a 1 TB external drive for main stuff?

How did you end up fixing it?. how did u do it?. Try taking the usb hub out of the mix. The error code points to iTunes, or in the case of Catalina, finder, not being able to communicate with the iPhone. Do you have any third party security software installed, or if you go to Apple logo > system preferences > firewall is Apple services set to allow (not sure what it looks like in Catalina off the top of my head since it’s no longer iTunes that’s used, but prior versions of macOS gave the option to block iTunes connections).

I plugged it into my pc and booted up I tunes and got greeted by two prompts basically giving me an option to update the phone, and if that didn’t work I’d have to wipe it.

833,(HELP) Need to Take Low Res Photos,gdsqyi,2020-05-05 06:46:24,"Hi there!

So for work I take tons and tons of photos everyday (500-1000), and my company has a cloud where I upload them, but in order to conserve space I need them to be small files. They prefer 640x480. 

Obviously iPhone natively takes high resolution photos, and aside from changing the photo “compatibility” settings and the video resolution, I haven’t been able to find a way to take 640x480 pics with the camera. 

My last work phone was an android and I had an app that would let me take 640x480 pics, but I haven’t had any luck finding an app like this for iPhone. 

Right now I’m stuck using Microsoft picture manager to resize them after plugging into my computer after a long day of work and doing it manually. It’s a huge pain in the ass, and would save me so much time if I could make them low resolution right from my iPhone, and upload them on the spot using my data. 

Does anybody know of any apps or hidden settings that can help with this?

All input is much appreciated.

838,iPhone photos to Windows 10,gdmcm3,2020-05-04 23:10:54,"I'm having really annoying problems backing up my wife's photo's to my PC. I'm an android user so please bear with me if my knowledge seems stupid. I haven't had an iPhone since the 4 (briefly with the 7 but never plugged it into a PC). My wife has 10'000's of photos and I'd like to put what I can on my PC and eventually into the cloud. I'd do this directly to google cloud but I don't want it running in the background all day, I can schedule this on my PC run in the small hours of the night (bandwidth isn't amazing so i don't want it ruining our internet during the day).

1. It's my understand that iCloud and her phone are fully synced and I cannot have stuff in the cloud but not of the phone?  
If this is the case my aim here is to add them to my google drive, as I believe she can download google photos and view things on her phone and it seems there's workaround to have it delete photos from the phone but not the cloud.
2. First thing I did was plug it into my PC and from memory. It worked like a USB stick for photos. I was simply going to copy and paste them.  
It's only showing me a handful of photos in a handful of folders. 103APPLE, 105APPLE...107,1108 111,117,121,125 and 126. Some are empty, some have a single photo in them and the last one has about 20.   
I tried using photos as per apple's instructions but just see's the above photos.   

3. I previously set up iCloud on my PC to sync with a folder on my PC. It's hasn't synced since January (I know it's been on as I've seen it running on several occasions. 
4. Iit's on now and not doing everything). I ran it not long ago and it's downloading 26,000 items. I suspect I'm getting more duplicate copies of photos. I had previously seen it up to date. It was easy to set up on my C drive but a pain in the ass (and I work in IT) to set up on a secondary drive. Ideally, I don't use iCloud as it's a hunk of shit and I've tried to use it several times over the years and is by far the most troublesome program I've ever had to deal with (and I have many clients that use all sorts of weird and wonderful programs).

When iCloud photos is turned on, all photos are uploaded to iCloud and a small thumbnail is displayed on the device. When you click on a picture it downloads it to show the full res version. It does this to save space when you have the option to “Optimize iPhone Storage” selected. 

The easiest way to get a copy of all of the photos in iCloud is to use iCloud for Windows and download them as I believe you said you are doing. 

Alternative method would be to turn off iCloud Photos on the phone, tell it to download and keep originals, and then copy them from the folders on the phone as you used to. I imagine this may not be an option with the number of photos you are trying to copy.. The hell that is ""optimize""

*sigh*. So regarding getting it off the phone. This makes sense. But why are there the odd photo here or there? There a block of somewhat recent photos from January in there and nothing since. I would assume it's videos and photos we have looked at recent at which is downloaded to view but it isn't that. Anyway, yes it's too much so it won't work.

iCloud is now my issue. All the dupes and nothing downloaded in months. I thought screw it, I can just redownload everything. I tried changing the folder to it went to to start over but iCloud was in the middle of an update (it wasn't as it happened after 2 restarts and I had already updated).

So I uninstalled and reinstalled. Now it's missing the option to download photos and videos. Just upload photos or download shared folders. Turned in the iCloud option and that works fine though. It was 2am and that's when I gave up.. I think if you hold down Shift, or Ctrl, or Alt when clicking the tray icon for iCloud you will get the download all photos option again.

We have individual iCloud accounts.

I have MacBook Pro (rMBP early 2013) only I use (and occasionallynconnect my phone to charge up).

Up until January of this year, we shared an iMac (mid 2015 iMac 5k). Both computers were running Catalina. 

Both iPhones are Xs Plus with automatic updates enabled.

Could we have accidentally synced our information thru the iPhone (iTunes?) app on the iMac?

We aren’t on a famiky plan and currently each have individual icloud storage plans and purchase apps individually.. I’d you have syncing turned on, it’s possible to both sync to the same computer and have each other’s data mixed together, yes.. Understood.

Is there any setting I can change to remove this feature? I want her to be able to use my MacBook to charge her phone without her info syncing to my computer or mine getting synced to her phone.. We now use iCloud to sync personal data (contacts, keychain, calendars) so now the computer is only used for music, videos and device backups.

Why have shared contacts list for people we both need (ie family members) and calendars (family bills, family events) which go through a seperate iCloud account.

851,HEIC images taken on iPhone X are larger than Apple's Image Capture exports,gcvtr1,2020-05-03 18:45:26,"TL;DR: Image Capture on the Mac is exporting HEIC images smaller than they were stored on the iPhone. Am I losing photo quality here and if so how do I transfer my iPhone's photos exactly as they are saved on the device?

Full Details: 

To make use of all the time we've got right now as a result of the quarantine, I've been collecting all my photos from various different devices over the years and storing them in one location ready to upload to the cloud.  

Although I had my fair share of issues with some Android phones, trying to get the photos off my iPhone X onto a Windows PC has been nothing short of a nightmare. I won't go into it too much here but I want to upload these photos into the cloud as JPG's not HEIC's, however, iOS's automatic conversion feature does not work at all and crashes everytime I try to move the folders over. I also get the same result when I turn on the 'Keep Originals' option. 

After much frustration, I've decided to use the Image Capture application on my Macbook Air to just move the entire library over to a USB as HEIC's. Then I'll find a good converter to change them into JPG's. When I compare the exported file on my USB to the exif data of the exact same photo on my iPhone X though, I'm noticing massive size differences. Often entire megabytes... 

I want these transferred photos to be the same quality as they are on the phone itself. That's why I haven't used any 3rd party transfer tools, to avoid a loss in quality. Image Capture seems to be doing this anyway though. 

Does anybody understand why Image Capture is exporting my photos at a drastically lower size than the originals and how I can get around this at all? Any suggestions or ideas would be much appreciated!",2,1.0,2.0,"Go to settings>photos. In the bottom you'll find transfer to mac or pc. Check keep originals..

This should help. I had the same problem few days ago while trying to backup my photos and occurs the same problem. Solved it with the link’s first tutorial.. I use iCloud.com. Honestly, I just use google photos. I gave up on trying to transfer them onto my computer. I take a ton of pictures of cars, my dog, scenery, etc; and all I have to do is open google photos and hit sync then boom.

I also like google photos because it categorizes everything, so I can open the app and search for what I wanna see.. Here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201302. PhotoSync. Works like a charm. So easy.. Thank you, I saw the video, maybe it is because I tried to copy 20gb of photos all at once... Yeah but I got 20gb of photos while iCloud base storage is 5GB, 15gbs of photos are not uploaded. But does it have unlimited storage?. Tried everything from this website but the thing is my photos were not uploaded to iCloud because I have 5gb iCloud while my pictures are 20gb.
The other thing when I tried to copy paste them or import them from photos it says device is unreachable or can’t connect.. You can increase your storage to 50gb for a dollar a month. If you don't want this storage just do it till the transfers are complete and then cancel. It's as easy to cancel as it is to enroll. It's worth it as it's so easy to transfer photos this way.  Go to iCloud.com, click photos, select all, click download.. This might give your answers: https://riverinter.net/random/free-extra-cloud-storage-iphone/. Honestly, I have no clue.

- update itunes 
- disable firewall (remember to turn it back on later)
- try with other cable

You should DFU restore to stock, then either setup as new or restore a backup from before the jailbreak was applied.

I’d be more interested in why you ‘couldn’t get the update’. Why?. If I restore will the update still be available?. Jailbreaking puts files deep into iOS file system that can’t be deleted manually.. Should be.

What model device?

What were you running before the update?

What are you running now?. So should I rejailbreak then?. I’m on iOS 12.4 and iOS 13 is available now thanks to the jailbreak but it says the iPhone will try to update later tonight.. No?? You should make a backup and reinstall iOS.. What model iPhone?. Ok I will thanks man. iPhone XR. iOS 13 is available for that model, something was blocking the update.

Is it a managed device, does it (or rather did it) have any config profiles, or was it jailbroken previously?. It was jailbroken previously but I deleted it. And just now I’m jailbreaking it again so I can I update I didn’t think it would work but it did. >it was jailbroken previously 

And there it is 🙄

How did you ‘delete’ the jailbreak?. I just deleted the app. 🤦🏻‍♂️

That doesn’t undo what’s been changed to the base OS.

So what happened is that jailbreaking deliberately break updates (since updates aren’t tested against jailbroken devices and can cause data destroying issues).

You never removed the jailbreak, so updates were still broken.

DFU restore to stock to *correctly* remove all traces of jailbreak, and  iTunes/Finder will install 13.4.1 during setup.. Pls don’t ever jailbreak because you can’t just delete unc0ver you have to delete Cydia. I did jailbreak my phone a second time but this time I enabled allow updates. So?

Turn it off.. That rust is corrosion. Unfortunately the worst think to do after a phone gets wet is plugging it into a charger or powering it on. Your best bet is to take it to a repair shop to replace the charging port and make sure there's no board damage.. If you never have repaired a iPhone I would tell you NO! Also just replacing the charging port may fix it but the motherboard still has water damage you will need to soak in in 99% isopropyl and NO RICE I mean no rice ever for a iPhone. New charging port will not fix it. yes I know, but can it be saved? Maybe hard reset?. Do u think theres a big chance of being the charging port?. I habe repaired before. Also adding since you opened in I would suggest a new screen. That can also cause the boot loop but if you can get it into dfu to show update and update the device does it show 4013?. >maybe hard reset

🤨. A software reset isn’t gonna undo hardware damage.

Turn it off, place it in an airtight container with desiccant and leave it for a while.  (Ideally, remove the display assembly and disconnect the battery).

Or take it to a repair shop.. It sounds like the charging port is shot for sure but there's a chance that when it was plugged into the charger it shorted something else out as well causing the boot loop. Yes that was the error that shows. What is it?. Do u think it would go into boot loop if the charging port is fucked?. Lol your NAND is fried the phone is gone. You will need a solder but I haven’t even gotten that fixed. You will need a new phone. It's possible but a tech would need to open it up to know for sure. Well my friend took to ubreakifix and they bs saying it was the screen that was damage. I thought it would also be the charging port but im uncertain. A bad screen probably wouldn't cause a boot loop but it is possible. If there's corrosion on the charging port it almost will definitely need a new one. Unfortunately water damage like that will sometimes also mean board level repairs. I would recommend cross posting to r/mobilerepair and see what they have to say. Yeah i figured. Might as well try it. Its $8 on ebay for a new charging port. there's only corrosion on the charging port tho. That's the only visible corrosion but there could be more on the underside of the board or under one of the covers on the board.

My phone is oldish (iPhone SE((not the new one)) and I’ve had it for a few years, dating back to when I was with my ex-boyfriend who would log into my accounts to take screenshots of my messages, and look up really disgusting things on my browser.

Is there anything suspicious in Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management?. Do you have apps open in the background that may be using your microphone?. Here are a few methods to distinguish if your device has been compromised.

1. Firstly, just as a precautionary measure make sure you don’t have apps such as TeamViewer Quick Support which is often used by malicious third parties to record / share your screen with them. 

Next, the most most likely way is by installing a profile on your device 

2. Go to Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management 

(a) now if you see Profiles & Device Management it means there is a profile on your device and you can delete it from here 

(b) you don’t see the option for Profiles & Device Management which means you don’t have a profile installed on your device 

3. Now since we know there isn’t any profile let’s make sure your device isn’t jailbroken. The easiest method is to update your device to the latest version of iOS currently iOS 13.4.1 

(a) you see the update and install it successfully. Means you aren’t jailbroken.

(b) you can’t see or install the update means someone has either jailbroken your device or you need to reinstall iOS to clear up a bug / glitch.

4. Next make sure that your account hasn’t been compromised. Change your password on your iCloud Account. Do so by using a complex password and make it as long as possible (long passwords are more secure than short complex ones). Use a password manager in order to make it easier to remember them. You can find apples build in password manager in Setting > Passwords & accounts > Website & App passwords. 




These are all the methods that someone can try to comprise your device if you don’t have any rest assured your device hasn’t been compromised. I came up with these since my dad is constantly paranoid that he’s being watched and I tried to help eliminate those suspicions to no avail. But I hope this helps you at least..

907,My iPhone 6 died,gawz8h,2020-04-30 14:45:45," I have an iPhone 6 (don’t know the iOS). It currently has no warranty.

My phone died yesterday.

For about two months I’ve been using for about half of the time an extension cord from which the charger would come out and disconnect easily / wouldn’t sit firmly. For about 2-3 weeks the phone started having problems with charging. I would plug the phone and it wouldn’t start charging unless I would:

\-unplug it and plug it back in, but turned 180 degrees

\-unplug it and plug it back in a lot of times

\-leave it plugged for a longer period of time

(none of the things above were a definite solution, usually 1 of the 3 would work, but I never knew which)

Yesterday I let it charge like usual in that extension cord (I think the battery was about 40%) and found it dead 20 mins later. The phone wasn’t dropped or hit or anything.

I cleaned the charging port (although there was nothing there). I long pressed the home and the lock button. I plugged it into the laptop. I let it charge for a longer period of time. I bought a new cable and did all of the above.

The screen shows nothing.

I also wanted to check the charging port connector and disconnect and reconnect the battery connector, like in this video ([https://youtu.be/gvTgzugSpiM?t=257](https://youtu.be/gvTgzugSpiM?t=257)), but I didn’t find small enough screwdrivers to unscrew those 2 tiny screws.",1,0.67,0.0,notexthere,0.0,4,232,0

I’ve been an iPhone user for over 5 years, currently with my XS. I finished up my college recently and have a lot of work needs on my phone, especially calls and WhatsApp. I got the XS when it launched especially for the dual sim, so that I can use separate numbers for work and personal. However, lately, it’s not been enough differentiation and I’ve decided on getting an entirely separate phone, which is helped w a relatively inexpensive SE2 coming into the picture. 

I’m deep into the ecosystem so android wasn’t an option for me, but I’ve a major concern which I’ve not been able to solve by googling. I want to know how I can set up that phone with the same Apple ID in a way that it doesn’t sync data such as the messages or photos from my personal phone while still being able to sync data to iCloud which is natively on my work phone. I also want to know if I can use that phone w my Apple Watch since it’s the same Apple ID or not.

I’m from India, if that is relevant for the answers. Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks!",6,1.0,26.0,"Don’t.

Create a seperate AppleID for ‘work you’, then share things you need from ‘work you’ to ‘personal you’.. So you will use duel sim for work part?. This is the way to do it.... I mean, you COULD sign in with your personal Apple ID, but you would be disabling every feature and service to stop syncing their wouldn’t be a point. Plus, it it accidentally gets set to sync through an update, then you get the fun job of sorting it all out.. Okay, thank you! I’ll consider making a different ID but it’ll be rough to lose access to all the subscriptions I have on my current ID.. No, I currently have my work number on the eSim. I’ll shift that to the SE and keep the XS as my personal phone.. >fun job

Having had to help clean up after a few people who mixed things I could think of other terms for this... 😉😂. What sort of ‘subscriptions’?. Family plan the apple IDs and you can share apps, subscriptions without syncing.. Okay so their will be 2 phones then involved hmm I actually never thought of this... but wait if you don’t want your work messages going to other device why don’t you just sign out of iMessage with email. And only use your email under messages? Wouldn’t that work. Yeah, I have some experience in helping people clean that mess up. When icloud was first introduced, you’d have mothers and daughters sharing texts, sons and fathers deleting contacts and calendars. Mothers getting their sons photos... cause for years and years, everyone shared an Apple ID to share purchases. iCloud pops up and NO ONE knew how to handle it.. Mostly just Apple Music (I know I could get the family membership but I’m not paying extra for a single device), YouTube premium and iCloud storage. They’re not exactly must haves, but it’ll be an adjustment.. I considered that but I wouldn’t prefer paying extra for that. I would rather not have them, which would be okay since it’ll be my work phone only. Thanks though!. iMessage isn’t that widely used where I am, as I mentioned in the post. It’s WhatsApp mostly, and currently you can only have one number active per device on WhatsApp. So I don’t have a separate WhatsApp for work and personal, which is mostly why I want a separate device.. ... little sister getting links via handoff to what the elder brother was watching in the privacy of his bedroom 😱..

How can I have my two phones be used iPhone 8 Plus and XR both are locked and I don’t want to spend any money on them is their a way to get the iCloud unlocked by opening it or I don’t know???. Yeah they can't help either tried this. Any reason why it’s locked? Is it yours?. You can get it unlocked by logging into your iCloud account and erasing the phone. If you don’t remember your iCloud account password, then go to iforgot.apple.com. If none of that works you can go to an Apple store with proof of purchase and they can erase it. 

If you are asking how to bypass an iCloud lock, the answer is—you can’t and refer to rule #1 on the sidebar.. Got it for a deal both $300.00 off on FB market but there is no profile of the person anymore. How do you determine no profile of previous owner?. Easy you look for the person on FB. then you have your cousins see if the person is on FB. then you have your friends see if the person is on Facebook and if the person is not on any of the FB we pulled up then you determine the person is not on Facebook.. Oh. Lol. I actually thought you meant there isn’t profile/iCloud of the previous owner on the phone.

If you’re talking FB, then easily they sold you a stolen good.. If they are still linked to someone else’s iCloud they are likely stolen devices, in which case you are SOL.

Please take this as a lesson learnt, and do not buy from insecure sites.. To me it isn’t the problem of ppl buying from insecure sites but rather they are not educated in this part as a buyer, to always check and know what to inspect instead of just able to turn on and off and the exterior of the phone.

959,iPad Pro Screen Coming Off... Now iPad Seems Dead,g9a2by,2020-04-27 21:38:38,"I noticed my iPad Pro screen was starting to come up in the lower left corner. I took the iPad out of the hard case to get a closer look, which I guess was a mistake, because as I was taking it out the screen went black and now it’s totally unresponsive.

i tried plugging it in to my computer to see if it would show up, and nothing.

I suspect that part of the issue is with a bad repair job. I had the screen replaced about a year ago. The home button has never worked right since then, it’s depressed and only works for fingerprint ID, which means I can’t hold it down along with the power button to reset.

I went ahead and removed the screen and found that when it separated, it disconnected the LCD ribbons, so I reconnected those and closed it back up. However it still won’t turn on.

960,Android guy looking to possibly try out IPHONE. Help!!!,g9a0ko,2020-04-27 21:36:08," 

Hey guys I'm an android guy for sure. But I might take a chance (won't sound like much of a big leap) but I'm thinking about trying out an iphone. But only a very cheap / older Iphone. Almost as a test or sampling how iphones work. Can anyone suggest what Iphone I should get? I keep hearing mostly iphone 5 or 6,6s or even possibly the 7?

My only requirements are that it must be in the $50 to $90 range (I would be buying it from amazon, or craigslist or something used for sure.) Also I want it to have solid battery life (which I love about iphones) and needs to be able to handle apps well. Thinks like facebook live, or cam streaming sites, skype type of apps. Thanks in advance.",0,0.5,17.0,"Honestly for that budget you’re not going to like the iPhone experience. 
If you want a decent phone the new SE is awesome, and if it doesn’t fit your needs, you’ll be able to sell it and not lose too much. 

Spending $90 on an 6S or lower would in my opinion be a waste of good money. The 7 is the absolute lowest spec I can recommend today, and I don’t think you’ll find one in your price range.. Ok fair enough. I'm in the situation where I don't NEED OR REALLY WANT an iphone. But I do want to kind of get use to down the road if it ""changes my life"" like people swear. Then I would like to be kind of use to iphones and see what I been missing or the ""other side"" so I was trying to take baby steps and get an iphone and just use it out if it sucks or old then move on. But I do not want to pay alot for basically a 3rd phone for myself (samsung a50, and samsung s7 that I currently have now) so kind of unique different situation that I'm trying to find.. Yeah but getting a 6S or lower will suck, the 6S will likely not be updated in September, it’s slow and it will give you a shitty the experience. 

It’s your money, but if I were you and don’t have a budget, stick with what you have until you have the money, $90 is almost 1/4 of a new SE.. Thats the thing I'm not trying to ever buy a new phone let alone an iphone ( i just dont believe in paying 1,000$ for a phone let alone even anything over 300/400 dollars at most. I currently have a samsung s7 and a samsung a50. I wanted to get the feel for an iphone and see what the hype is about. But I didn't want to spend 500+ dollars to buy something I really dont want or might not like and waste my money. That's why I was trying to get something that I can try out and not spend that much money so if I don't like it theres not too much downside. And if I do like it then maybe 1 or 2 years from now buy the iphone models thats currently out now. But saving up to buy a brand new phone is not an option since I wouldn't ever buy a brand new phone iphone or samsung regardless.. Then buy what you want, you asked for advice, I’ve given you mine.. No I understand what your saying. I'm just trying to get the most ""bang for my buck"" like I know nothing about iphones. And if I only want to spend less than $100 which would be considered the best model in that price range for those models.. I wouldn’t buy an iPhone in that price range for my worst enemy.

Depends on use case and expectation, I wouldn’t go lower than an iPhone 5S for basic tasks (as a replacement dumb phone for example), but for someone who wants a smart phone, I wouldn’t go below an 8 series.. Everyone has said either the iphone 6s or the iphone 7 for that price. So trying to get an idea if that phone is even worth it in todays age. Could this phone stillwork and be functional as a ""starter iphone"" or an introductory to apples iphones?. If you can find a decent iPhone 7 for less than $90 that’s not iCloud locked, go for it.. I have family members using the 6S and 7 series are primary phones, they are supported by the current OS, but (in my area at least), I wouldn’t find one from a reputable dealer for that price range.

Often cheap devices are third party repaired (or worse, iCloud locked to the person it was stolen from) and will not be worth the aggravation.. If you're trying the iPhone experience you won't get it with anything before a 7 or 8. Ok perfect thats what I will look for. When you said icloud locked? Can you explain what that is? and how to check that?. iCloud lock is like the google lock on an android phone. The account has to be removed from the phone before a new account be be logged in. If you click on the settings app (assuming the phone hasn’t been reset) there should be an option to sign into an iCloud account at the very top. If there is already a name/email at the top, make sure it is removed before paying for the phone. If the phone has already been reset, go through the first few setup pages and it should prompt you to login to or create an iCloud account. If it says an account is already signed in and is asking for the password, you won’t get past that screen without the password. 

Long story short. Don’t hand over any money before verifying there is no iCloud attached to the phone. It is not possible to sign out of iCloud without the user’s credentials.  If you have an iPhone that is still signed into someone else’s account they still have control of it (they can lock it remotely, they can trace its location etc).

Without the correct iCloud credentials, the only way to remove this is to DFU restore, however Apple added a check during the activation process where you have to enter the registered iCloud account credentials to complete setup.  (Known as ‘Activation Lock’)

Without the iCloud account details, it is not possible to complete activation and thus the device is useless.

Only way to check is to attempt to activate (before handing over any money).  If it asks for iCloud login, it’s activation locked.. iCloud lock is a lock that’s impossible to remove, and will make your phone useless. It’s to prevent theft.

However, how’d that matter in this context?. Interesting, possibly a restart or a backup and restore might help.. If the phone has water damage it can cause issues later on. I been fixing devices for 3 years I never seen a device just randomly do it but since you said water damage I would have to go with that. Then why does it forget to do it for every single other application or when I give the phone more fingerprints or use the scanner to approve payments etc?

It seems to be selectively doing this just for the unlock feature from the home button. That’s why I think hardware damage is the least likely explanation.. I would say backup your phone and then restore it I haven’t had that happen in a while to anyone I have fixed. Have you tried having someone scan their finger and if it fails to show it scanned it ?.

983,what is “OTHER” and why is it using all my storage??,g8khs5,2020-04-26 19:17:13,"So I’ve been having an issue with my iPhone, where I don’t have enough storage to do...well anything. This really started to impact me about a week ago, I have the iPhone 11 Pro, 64gb. I had roughly 3,600 photos and videos on my phone (my phone said 27gb) and numerous apps. I started getting the pop up “no storage” so I started to comb through my photos and videos and ended up with only 1200 photos and video on my phone. So at first when I go back to the storage menu it says nothing has changed....so to google I go, I end up resetting the date manually, and see my photos have now dropped to 23gb, only 5 GB, for that many? I mean I guess. But when I look at the main storage tab, I am still at 62.3gb???? So I scroll to the bottom of that menu to see “OTHER” has now gone from 14gb, to 19gb??? So I wait a few days idk maybe hoping for it to fix itself?? Obviously nothing has happened so I think maybe I need to delete videos because that’s more story probably? So I just now deleted 18min of video off my phone for photos/videos to drop from 23gb to 18gb, but my overall storage?? STILL at 62.3???? And OTHER has now gone up to 24gb???

Thank you in advance for you help in this matter!",2,1.0,8.0,"I switched from a 7 Plus to the iPhone 11 (not the pro), and it was worth it for me, the display is as good if not better than the 7 Plus because it is more vibrant.

Hope this helped with the decision and sorry for the long answer.. I'm in the same situation, I have an iphone 7 plus that has some issues (blown-out ear piece, charging troubles, lagging, battery life issues, etc). I am thinking the same thing, get an iphone 11 for now, hold out until whatever flagship comes out in 2021 (skip iphone 12). Get battery replacement iphone 7 plus, keep up ios update and make sure storage no use up. Speed should return. As for which iphone to upgrade, that depend on your own financial budget suit you..

I'm not sure if I am not performing the DFU reset properly but have been following guides to do it. Is there anything else I can try or will it need taken in somewhere?",1,1.0,18.0,"1. Be sure you are actually using DFU mode and not Recovery Mode.
2. Pre-Download the IPSW for your phone and use it to restore in DFU mode. 

It will be one of these:

 [https://ipsw.me/download/iPhone9,3/17E262](https://ipsw.me/download/iPhone9,3/17E262). ew.  no error number?

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204770

tried a different cable, maybe a different computer with itunes?

otherwise, yeah, apple can take a look and try it. This might be a bad case of loop disease, which means it might be a motherboard issue. Apple might be able to replace it for free.. It might be a case of loop disease, which is a board level problem. Luckily, Apple might be able to replace it for free.. Will try DFU again to make sure thank you!.

I had tried downloading the ipsw, but the option to use it to restore doesn't come up anywhere when I go into (what I think is) DFU mode. I tried holding down options key but nothing came up.. nope no error number!

will give a different cable a go, thanks. My Mac  needs updating too so this could maybe help?. Just looked up loop disease it does seem to fit criteria for it so will try to contact apple, thank you!. There is a keystroke to hold while clicking restore to trigger a pop up to open the IPSW file. On windows it’s Ctrl+Shift. No idea on Mac.. perhaps...worth a try.

good luck!. As an owner of an iPhone 7 that also has a recall out for modem failure as well as Loop Disease, you're welcome.. Have just tried this but still getting the corrupt firmware issue, probably going to have to take it in somewhere when lock down is lifted. thank you!. While it’s attempting is the screen blank or does it have something on it?. It's blank when I followed the DFU steps, and has the connect to PC thing on it when I followed recovery mode steps. Sounds right. And neither will do anything?

I don’t know if a 7 is new enough to be worth paying for repair (if not under warranty) vs just buying a new SE. 

I’d get a quote from Rossman Group out of NY.. Nope both seem to download the software onto my Mac fine, but then give the corrupt firmware message when trying to restore the phone

Can't afford a new one right now (im a student), was planning on getting an 11 or an X when I start my grad job in September and when my contract for the 7 runs out. Will look into repair cost (UK based!) but might just try to get a second hand 6/6s until I start working.. Do you have access to a windows pc? Try flashing it with 3uTools instead of Finder/iTunes.. Got a very old one that runs very slow, could take a while but will try this thank you!",472.0,7,104,0
