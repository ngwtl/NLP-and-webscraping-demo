also i‚Äôm afraid to power it off because the last phone i powered off it got stuck on the apple logo and i had to get it replaced so it‚Äôs kind of given me irrational fear now",,1

19,hcbxjz,"I‚Äôve never noticed. 

I‚Äôve never left an iDevice in DFU mode long enough to make a difference.  DFU mode is meant as a short term mode as a way to install iOS on a misbehaving device.",,1
20,hcbxjz,how do i fix?? i've tried update and restore in recovery mode,,1
21,hcbxjz,Do you get a error code ?,,1
22,hcbxjz,No it would begin to download and install. and on my laptop it would say download complete and restarting  iphone to install then after it tries to restart it would start the boot loop. :/,,1

24,hcbxjz,how,,2
25,hcbxjz,Are you on mobile?,,1
26,hcbxjz,i am using my laptop currently. My phone is still in DFU mode i assume.,,1

Tell me if it works",,1
28,hcbrxs,wym? while charging? doesn't that take it out of DFU mode?,,1
29,hcbrxs,It should turn on your device. Do u want it to work or what?,,1
30,hcbrxs,yes. i'll give it a try,,1
31,hcbrxs,Aight. Tell me what happens.,,1
32,hcbrxs,Just tried it a couple times. screen is still black and unresponsive as if its still in DFU.,,1
33,hcbrxs,Hold the lock and home button at the same time until u see something. (10-15 seconds),,1
34,hcbrxs,Held it for like 30 seconds. still nothing,,1
35,hcbrxs,"Then it‚Äôs not a DFU related incident.

37,hcbrxs,The. That‚Äôs why take it back to the store their screen is bad get you‚Äôre refund and go somewhere else,,2
38,hcbrxs,"Probably the motherboard. Ur phone is gone. 

Not 100% tho 

Check the Apple store",,1
39,hcbrxs,wym? refund on screen? how will that fix my boot loop problem?,,1
40,hcbrxs,Coulda recent screen repair be the possible reason do you think?,,1
41,hcbrxs,"Maybe, but keep the alarm thing on the left on while your phone is charging. Email or dm yourself and see if there is a ring. If there is then it works but the screen doesn‚Äôt.",,2
42,hcahmf,They are probably dead or broken pixels. Are they very small dots or small areas where more light bleeds trough ?,,2

76,hc225x,Hmm strange it only happens when reaching a certain section of scrolling as if when chrome executes infinite loading elements of the page it starts doing this. And since I guess safari doesn't work the same way it doesn't do the same,,1
77,hc225x,Could it be that when you scroll a certain distance you happen to touch a certain part of the screen? What happens if you try and interact while it does that? does it try to do multi finger gestures like zooming and stuff,,1
78,hc225x,"Just tried it and everything works fine with the photo app. No flickering or anything, tried the same with ibooks where again I'm scrolling down infinatelly and the issue doesn't happen.

87,hc0f6a,Well that's helpful! thanks,,1
88,hc0f6a,Many of those apps browse the backup made before the phone stopped working.,,1
89,hc0f6a,"So there's no hope at all then? Is there any way I can hack into it or something? Cuz I would do anything for my data. If I just wanted the phone to work, I could've have done a reset a long time ago but the photos are what I want.
Apple has to have some feature for it, I mean I have my apple id password and even know the passcode! What more do they want to verify that it was my phone? üòñ",,1
90,hc0f6a,"That would enable them to reset your device.  They‚Äôll never do data recovery.

98,hbxnli,It doesn't make any sound. I am also thinking that it could be a damaged board. I need a phone at the moment and won't be getting a new one until later this year so I was always going to replace this.,,1
99,hbtbcs,"This situation often occurs after updating the iOS system on your iPhone. And many Apple users also reported they encounter the same situation after updating.  You can try to put your iPhone 7 into the recovery mode.  

Here are the step to put your iPhone 7 into recovery mode.

Step 1.  Connect your iPhone to the computer and open iTunes. Press the Power button and the Volume Down button concurrently.

Step 2.  Similarly, the Apple logo screen will display. Simply hold them until you see the Connect to iTunes screen.

Or you can just download TunesKit iOS system recovery software which can provide you the function that 1-click to enter/exit recovery mode for free. And it also helps you fix all the iOS issues without data loss. So you don't need to back up the data on your phone.",,2

131,hbljtj,It's probably a hardware problem and you may have only one choice: take it to an Apple store for inspection and repair.,,3
132,hbljtj,It's the green line of death that happens when the oled displays fail. Had it happen to my IPX. Contact apple support and they'll swap the screen out for you.,,1
133,hbljtj,"I see. I never dropped my iphone, not even once and yet now this üò¢",,1
134,hbljtj,But im out of warranty. Plus ive seen in macforums some users are having the same problems. Green tint appears on the screen randomly but doesnt affect the performance of the phone at all,,1
135,hbljtj,It could just be due to a defect that has resulted in this problem after having the phone for a while.,,3
136,hbljtj,I would still contact apple and explain your situation. If your lucky they might be willing to swap it. When you contact make sure to be adamant that the device has suffered no damage and it is clearly a issue with the supplied display.,,1
137,hbljtj,My screen works fine though. Nothing is wrong with it even my touch screen. If the green line disappears it still work amazingly. Sadly i know that there is still a problem with my phone.,,1
138,hbljtj,Is there any way to contact apple without having to go to their store?,,1
139,hbljtj,Yep online chat function and if you get the ok they‚Äôll send you a box you slap the phone in send it in and after about a week it‚Äôll be back.,,2
140,hbljtj,"Thank you. I will try to contact them tomorrow. But im not sure if i can fix it in < 2 months since i am financially strained. Do you think that my screen can still function well in this period? If i dont fix it, will it affect the motherboard etc?",,1
141,hbljtj,It should‚Äôt affect the logic board as the issue most likely originated from the display drive chip on the screen itself. I would probably say the phone will work fine for the next 2 months it‚Äôll just be a bit annoy sometimes.,,1
142,hbljtj,Thank you! That should kept me from having the issue bugging my mind again!,,1
143,hbjbcw,Does the screen protector cover the proximity sensor? If so there‚Äôs a chance that could cause issues (I doubt it though).,,2
144,hbjbcw,"Try to restart your phone and remove the protector and see if this situation still exists.  Or you can try to update the iOS system on your phone to the latest version. To fix the iOS system problem, you can try to repair the iOS system with TunesKit. And as you say, maybe the eBay seller changed the screen and caused some damaged inside your phone.  So you'd better go to the maintenance center to fix it.",,1

148,hbdsor,"How did you transfer the video from your dash cam to your iPhone initially?

&nbsp;

If there is a wired (or wireless) connection between your phone and the camera, and the video is still stored locally on your dash cam, it‚Äôs conceivable that‚Äôs how the video reappears.

&nbsp;

In addition, if there is a cloud service to which your cam connects, such as Dropbox, it may have read/write access to your photos on iOS. I am unsure if cloud services (other than iCloud) currently have the ability to push photos and videos to your iOS Photos Camera Roll, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning.",,1
149,hbdsor,It‚Äôs turned off and I even cleared iCloud of everything except contacts.,,2
150,hbdsor,I used a memory card adapter to plug the memory card into my phone. Then used the ‚Äúfiles‚Äù app to download the video to my Photos app.,,2
151,hbdsor,"Doesn‚Äôt sound like that would be the culprit, then. If you turned off all the iCloud syncing options except for contacts as you stated, including iCloud Drive, it‚Äôs possible the video gets transferred back if you sync your phone to iTunes or the Mac Photos app via cable or Wi-Fi somehow. That assumes the video is on your other device and it detects the video is ‚Äúmissing‚Äù on your phone, resulting in its restoration.

&nbsp;

Apple Support could probably help you if none of that seems likely, since they‚Äôre the experts. You can call them on the phone or use a form on the Apple website and someone will email you back with a reply. For this, I‚Äôd suggest a phone call.",,1

175,hb3qz1,"Fold a paper towel up into a little square pad. Soak it with water and then squeeze most of the water out but allow some to remain inside. Maybe squeeze out 75% of the water.

With the iPhone oriented sideways so that the side button is on top, press the button repeatedly through the paper towel while allowing water to squeeze out to wash out the button area. This should be far safer than just putting the button under running water or putting the button just barely under standing water and pressing it.

iPhone 7 is the first iPhone to have water resistance, so this should be safe. However, it's your choice whether you do this, so if any water damage occurs, I will not be held responsible. I'm just telling you what you can do because I believe there's no other way unless you want to take it to an Apple store and have them clean it. That could be expensive.

I have iPhone 11 and I did this successfully. I accidentally got a little lemonade splashed onto my side button which later resulted in the clicky feeling being completely eliminated. After doing what I described above, it feels and operates just like new and it has felt and operated just like new ever since.

266,habga4,"> I did call my provider to block the device but I forgot to ask if the data within will still be accessible.

Welp, this may have wrecked your chances for deleting your data.

[Try going here](https://www.icloud.com/find). Login with your Apple ID, and see if the site can track the location of your phone.  If you're lucky, you might even be able to find out where it is and recover it!

Unfortunately, this requires that your phone be on and have a data connection. If you called your provider and had them block the phone, then it's no longer on the cellular network and won't get data that way.. Only if the phone has auto-connected to WiFi (or the person taking it has connected to a WiFi network or inserted a new SIM) will it show up here.

That site also gives you the option to wipe your phone remotely, but this also requires an active network connection.  Note that if you wipe the data from your phone remotely, you will no longer be able to track its location.

Next time you lose your phone, follow steps in this order:

* Login, track your phone, lock it down with a passcode and a ""contact me"" message
* If you can't locate or physically recover it, *then* do a remote data wipe
* *Then* contact your provider to block the device.

Note: If you had a passcode on your iPhone, then the data on it is encrypted. Whoever has your phone would need the passcode to unlock your device and get data off it.",,2

It is more likely that the battery needs to be replaced.

There is a PC application called 3utools which you can use to see how many cycles the battery has been through. iPhone batteries last about 500 cycles (One charge cycle is the battery discharge from 100% to 0%), so if your phone is showing 400+ cycles, then it is worth considering replacing the battery. 

FYI - If you discharge the battery to 50% and charge it up. Discharge it to 50% and charge it up, then that is one charge cycle.

As the battery ages from time and discharge cycles, it will become less efficient. By about 500 cycles, the battery would show approximately 80% capacity. For example - a new iPhone 6 capacity is 1810mAh, after 500 cycles, it would have about 1448mAh (80%). This will show up as ""100%"".

However, this may not diagnose any other faults or issues with the device.",,4
320,ha06dz,I agree that the battery likely needs to be replaced if the issue continues using an Apple-certified charging cable.,,1

322,h9y7sd,There must have been another iPhone connected to the Apple ID once. Don‚Äôt you recognise the iPhone at all by its name? Maybe you signed in on a friend/family member phone,,2

324,h9y7sd,The old phone was an SE. I signed out on the phone itself and removed it from iCloud. There's no other devices I would be signed into.,,1

331,h9tprw,"Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think there is a way to tell directly on the iPhone other than giving them different names. However, if you go into your routers settings, you can generally see how devices are connected (2.4 GHz, 5GHz or Wired.) You can also rename your 2.4 and 5GHz networks here as well. I usually give them different names since I live in an apartment, and there are usually over 20 networks in range that cause interference. Since 5GHz has a shorter range (which isn‚Äôt a concern in an apartment), this means that there is generally less interference from your neighbors networks.",,1

Deeper stuff check:

Are you up to date with iOS 13.5.1? Have you tried restarting your iPhone?

Are your other notification sounds playing normally?

Is the sound issue only while your iPhone is directly against your head? If you pull your iPhone away from your head (to the point the display comes back on) does the volume increase?

Turn off Attention Aware. Attention Aware will adjust volumes based on if the iPhone detects if you are actively using it or not. It should only adjust ringer and notification volumes, but it may be interfering with your call volume as well.

You go into Settings > Accessibility > Face ID & Attention > Attention Aware Features.",,1
342,h9nmeg,"I did reset all settings. And I just turned off the attention aware features, no change.",,1
343,h9nmeg,"Might want to reach out to Apple Support then. Let them know what you‚Äôve already tried and they will let you know what to do from there.

Just be forewarned, as I mentioned before, wait times have been between 20-30 minutes. Also, if you do need to have your iPhone serviced, the options are limited right now, but they will let you know what is available.

Call Verizon and see how to update the profile on their network. Reset phone. 

Other then that I don‚Äôt know why the person is getting redirected or not receiving phones. Maybe it‚Äôs the provider of one of the phones as you said people are pretty far apart. Maybe they got some weird restrictions going on.

Is the text messages going to B green? Or blue?

Green means it thinks B is a non iPhone. If blue it knows it‚Äôs a iPhone. I phones don‚Äôt send SMS to another iPhones anymore they use MMS encryption service. It sends SMS to a non iPhone and it displays a green bubble. Maybe it‚Äôs that. Try to delete both contacts on both phones and create new contacts and try again. 

Go to settings. Go to messages on both phones and make sure the iMessage is on.  Turn on the sms also if iMessages isn‚Äôt available at any time. iPhones will try to send it in MMS but will eventually send it in SMS if needed to.

508,h82951,"Rice really does nothing, it does not pull the moisture away from your device. As soon as you've got water in it the damage is done- corrosion is a chemical reaction and starts immediately.

The reason it has become a myth is because people leave their devices in rice for a few days and suddenly it works again, when the reality is simply that the water has evaporated from the internals.

As above once a device is water damaged, it will never be the same again. It might work for a few days, few months, a year etc. but it will always fail at some point due to the water.

652,h0ulf2,"Personally, I bought a waterproof Bluetooth speaker that hangs on my shower rack, that way I don‚Äôt have to risk my $1000 iPhone X in the shower. That would be my first recommendation. 

If you are going to have it with you in the shower I wouldn‚Äôt recommend putting it directly in the stream of water, it‚Äôs ‚Äúresistant‚Äù not ‚Äúwater proof.‚Äù If you have a shelf where it might get splashed, that‚Äôs safer, but you still want to try to avoid contact with water. 

On [Apple‚Äôs website about water resistance](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207043) it says the following. 

To prevent liquid damage, avoid these:
-	Swimming or bathing with your iPhone
-	Exposing your iPhone to pressurized water or high velocity water, such as when showering, water skiing, wake boarding, surfing, jet skiing, and so on

So like I said, maybe if you have a place where it might accidentally get a little splash, like a shelf or something up high, you could try that. But I would really recommend a waterproof Bluetooth speaker, they aren‚Äôt expensive, seen them for $40 and they sound better than iPhone speakers.",,1
653,h0ulf2,Buy either waterproof case or bluetooth speaker waterproof. Bluetooth speaker better option as sound be louder.,,1
654,h0ulf2,"I wouldn't bring it in touch with any liquid. It's only officially waterproof, and Apple doesn't apply their warranty to water damage. Many people had broken or damaged phones because they dropped their phone into the pool, the sink or because they used it in the shower. Don't.",,1
655,h0ulf2,"One more vote for Bluetooth speaker. DO NOT take in to the shower with you. Steam is reasonably safe (but not for 4-5 hours ofc), but not the direct water impact. Don't join the army of idiots that decided to swim in the pool with an expensive piece of tech.

If you'll still decide to take a shower with the phone, better make an encrypted backup before this.",,1

&#x200B;

 (by now, others have already mentioned helium)

838,gz7352,"UPDATE: So 4 days since it died, I realized only yesterday how known the issues with Iphone 8 and helium were by googling ""Iphone 8 helium"", I saw the fixit article and even how Apples user guide says they don't go well together. So the link is definitely there, and it seems unnecessary for me to test my phone in a plastic bag since others have already done that and documented on youtube. 

Now it's not like I spray my phone with helium while we weld, and noone starts talking funny because of it but we operate in a 170m3 room, and during 8-12 hours we use up about 1¬Ω 50l flask of helium pressurized to 200 bar. We seal the room as well as possible but we run the air in the room through a dehumidifier so I have no idea how much helium builds up. But it seems conceivable that with those conditions, enough of these little helium atoms could find their way into whatever part it is that makes this happen. 

I guess I can't be 100% sure this is the issue but it makes sense in a beautiful way, and it was really exciting to find about this. I read somewhere that Apple said to leave the phone to completely discharge for about a week before charging again should bring it back up, which matches our earlier experience. I guess in the future the best solution is to just not bring the phone to this workspace for this time. Which would be probably be the same solution as if I had concluded it would have been another aspect of this welding process that did the damage, but it still points to the gas.

Thanks for taking your time helping me out, it didn't cross my mind that it could be the gas before you guys brought it up.",,1

We've used the same welding machines for other jobs but me and my colleagues haven't seen it happen anywhere but in Germany. That might just be a coincidence that we happen to be working here at the same time as we are being issued a phone that are sensitive to just whatever this machine does.

Not all devices are made the same. It would make sense for this to be the cause, but not effect every device and location.

Try this. Triple bag your devices in zip lock bags (the helium will find its way in either way). See if it mitigates the occurrences to some degree",,2

Not sure how you could shield the phone from helium. I guess putting it in a baggie would help, but helium can actually propagate through the bag ever so slightly. But might be your best try to start with.

933,gydkg2,"You've rubbed off the oleophobic coating on those parts of the screen, which helps protect the screen from smudges (it's how fingerprints rub off really easily when you wipe your screen).

Oleophobic coatings are supposed to last for years but I guess if you keep rubbing/pressing the same spots it'll rub off sooner.  
How long have you been gaming on it (as in, hour-wise)?

Apple will likely see it as normal wear and tear, so the above question is important (because gaming on it for less than a couple of hours per day shouldn't do this, and should therefore be covered under warranty).",,3

You might be able to make it disappear by applying a tempered glass screen protector (a tempered glass one specifically, as it will better mask where the coating has rubbed off).",,2
937,gydkg2,"yes I am planning to use a tempered glass but I was simply curious as to whether I can get rid of those patches before doing so.

however is there any way that one can do something by themselves? or is it not worth the risks associated with doing so",,1

939,gydkg2,"so basically taking it all off to make it homogeneous, alright then.

also is there a way that after taking the entire thing off you can reapply an oleophobic coating evenly? 

which option would you go for actually, simply getting a tempered as it is rn or doing it after taking off the entire coating.",,1
940,gydkg2,"I'd remove the coating and then apply the tempered glass. I've seen products that claim to effectively re-apply the coating but have never seen one do what it says on the tin (aka, they don't work properly).

Search Google for ""macbook staingate remove coating"" for a step-by-step guide on removing it (the same problem of a coating coming off, but not the same root cause- will still apply here though).",,3
941,gydkg2,thanks a lot :),,1
942,gydkg2,"They work properly if you use them as directed. I am speaking from experience with the Crystal Armor Fusso oleophobic coating. Applying it properly requires patience and time, but it works as long as you do it correctly. One bottle is about $15 and it is enough for 1 ***full*** application. That's why it's a tiny bottle.

Now, here is how you use it (all of these steps are actually pretty easy to perform, and they all count as 1 full application):

1. Apply 10-15 drops evenly over the glass. Don't try to be perfect, you won't be able to do it perfectly.
2. Before it evaporates, spread it evenly to cover 100% of the glass using something that doesn't absorb liquid. I used a squeegee. **DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED BLACK MICROFIBER CLOTH**. That's just a free gift included with your purchase to help you with your daily cleaning of the glass.
3. Using a facial tissue or a paper towel, simultaneously rub it in and wipe it off.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 above 3 more times for a total of 5 mini applications (not to be confused with a full application)
5. Repeat steps 1-**2** above just 1 time.
6. Let the evenly-spread oleophobic coating product sit untouched for 8 or more hours. This is the curing process. This is the critical stage most people don't have the patience for and it's why they say it doesn't work. Thanks to Voice Control, you can still use the iPhone without touching it. So set it up before you do all of this. Don't be fooled into thinking just an hour or two is good enough. 8 or more hours. The longer the better. That's just how this stuff works.
7. After the 8+ hours of curing time, wipe off the excess until the glass *looks* clean. Use a facial tissue or a paper towel or a clean cotton cloth that you're willing to put into the laundry basket after because this stuff is a little bit oily. Don't touch the glass while you're doing this, or after.
8. Now use a wet paper towel or a wet cotton cloth (not dripping wet, just wet enough to clean the glass) and clean off the remaining oily residue that I guarantee you cannot see but it's there. So again, I advise try to avoid touching the display glass until you've completed this step, otherwise it'll be on your skin. It's a subtle oily residue. I'm sure you don't want to accidentally get it in your mouth or your eyes or transferred to some of your belongings.

After step #8 above, you will have completed the 1st of 5 full applications. Do this for 5 days in a row, and I guarantee you the glass will feel just like new for the next 6-8 months, just like Apple's oleophobic coating. Again, I'm speaking from experience.

Edit: After 1-2 or even 3 full applications, you'll believe you've done enough applications because it will feel brand-new again, but don't be fooled. Make sure you do all 5 full applications.",,3

It was simply a suggestion, and I never said it would 100% work. 

However if Apple refuses to remove MDM with proof of purchase, the company who locked the device refusing to remove MDM, and the seller refuses to refund, I see no alternative but to take both that company and the seller to small claims (assuming the OP _really wanted_ their device back working properly). 

I‚Äôd imagine the initiation of a small claims against them would be enough to get them to remove it, and even if not you have documentation that verify beyond doubt that it is your device. 

MDM is monitoring software, not sure what the laws are over in the US but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was highly illegal to place spying software on someone‚Äôs device without their permission (or being a law enforcement agency).",,2

1. Allow the power to run out until iOS shuts down automatically
2. Plug it in and leave it plugged in until the iPhone finishes recharging to 100%. Don't unplug it until it's done. Note: it could take 1-2 hours for the iPhone to turn back on and start up after you plug it in. This doesn't happen when you regularly recalibrate the battery.
3. When it's finished charging to 100%, shut down the iPhone and unplug it.
4. Start the iPhone back up (so yeah, turn it back on)

Repeat this about 4-5 times. You can try to do it all in one day, or one time per day. It doesn't matter. 4-5 times will be necessary since this is likely the first time you've ever done it with this old iPhone.

After you're done with the 1st of 4-5 0-100% recharges, you will notice a big improvement to the battery level reading's accuracy and you might even get slightly more battery power before you have to recharge.

And yes, what is the Maximum Capacity reading? (it's not ""Battery Health"", it's ""Maximum Capacity"", located in the Battery Health section of the Battery settings).

2382,gkkgb3,"Shut down your iPhone. Don't do any of this until it is completely powered off.

Fold up a paper towel into a tiny square, soak it with water, squeeze out some of the water but not all of it. Maybe leave about half the amount of water in it. You want this little square to be like a soaked sponge that is holding water but not dripping wet.

Orient your iPhone so that volume buttons are on top.

Now, use this paper towel ""sponge"" to squeeze out the remaining water over the buttons repeatedly by pressing the paper towel square ""sponge"" against the buttons.. You're rinsing out whatever has made the button become sticky/mushy. It's ok to press the buttons with the paper towel. In fact, I recommend it.

Do not run the iPhone under water as an alternative way to do this. I repeat: do not do it. This paper towel method is far safer. Yes, it's still risky, but if your Xr has no defects, the water you repeatedly squeeze out shouldn't go inside.

Do this a few times. By that, I mean, get more water into your little paper towel ""sponge"", squeeze maybe half of it out and then press it against the buttons again to try to rinse out whatever is in there.

When you've done it maybe 2-3 times altogether, you should use a dry paper towel to press the buttons and you should blow very hard around the entire circumference of the buttons to further help get the water out of there.

Now, test the buttons. If they are both clicky again, you may turn the iPhone back on. If this didn't solve the problem at all, then, well of course you can turn the iPhone back on but I would take it to an Apple store and have them look at it.

I have an iPhone 11 and I had a lemonade spill near my iPhone and some of it splashed against the Sleep/Wake button. A few hours later, my Sleep/Wake button lost its clicky feel and sound and it would stick as well. I did exactly as I described above and it restored it 100%.",,1

Now, iTunes (or any app like AnyTrans that is able to pretend to be iTunes) has access to a few of these sandboxes, like Photos, contacts, Music, etc. So the way you can add music to your phone is through those programs. They will not reside in your files, they will reside in Music‚Äôs sandbox.

at what point will apple not allow me to access the store because my ios version is too old ?",,1
2724,ggej4d,Lowest device I have iOS iOS 4 which lets me last I checked. I resell iPhones. But is pretty sure it‚Äôs because I have had apps downloaded before. So if you never downloaded apps at the time of iOS 4 or 6 etc etc then they prob won‚Äôt,,2
2725,ggej4d,"Any iPhone that supports downloading apps will always support downloading apps, as for what iphone model first provided access to the App Store, I‚Äôm pretty sure it was the iphone 3rd gen.  the problem isn‚Äôt with what model of iPhone supports downloading apps, itcomes in with whether or not the apps support the software and hardware version of your iPhone. App developers are who dictate what apps are available in the store, what devices those apps support, and what software those apps will work on. It‚Äôs why there are some apps that are available on the iPhone that aren‚Äôt available on the iPad even if they run the same up to date iOS version.",,2
2726,ggej4d,"so the 3rd gen iphone to this day has the ability to search the app store ?

another question .most apps on android target android 4.4.4 .

on IOS what is generally the most targeted version ?",,1
2727,ggej4d,"Latest ofc. Some apps do have latest compatible version available for the last compatible iOS version on the device, but not all of them.",,2
2728,ggej4d,"I would assume the third version supports the App Store, I didn‚Äôt get into iPhones until the 4th gen.... as for which apps work with which versions.... there really isn‚Äôt a way to determine that.... it‚Äôs all app developer specific. One app development company may have multiple apps that do different things, and because those apps do different things, hardware and security feature  requirements may be different, so dictates which version of iOS is supported.

For example, an app that supports a form of payment method would have different security requirements than say a game application. So the game application MAY be able to be run on a lower software/device version than the payment application, even though they are created by the same developer. 

It also comes down to who the app was written for. Devices get replaced and upgraded, so you see far more iPhone 8‚Äôs than you do iPhone 5‚Äôs. Would you spend money supporting a device/software that is only used by a small fraction of users, or would you concentrate on devises/software that has a larger user base? If you make money supporting the larger user base, but loose money on the smaller user base, it becomes an easy choice for the developers.",,1

Its not so much getting them to not use the cloud for everything, I like the idea of sharing stuff between my devices. Honestly, between that and the icloud email addresses, is the only reason I continue to use my iphone...and facetime and walkie talkie on the apple watch.

The big thing that i dont like is that simple fact that when you take pictures or videos, you have to go through holy hell in order to get any of them on your computer at all...and the issue with transferring any of them to icloud then bringing them to your computer that way, causes you to lose a bit of the resolution and stuff...cause like, they advertise good lookin pictures and videos, but if you do THAT, it loses something...

Plus, who the hell wants to sit there for hours (maybe) to download a very large, or multi part 4k video, and risk some kinda transfer issue happening and losing some or all of it during the download?

They basically don't leave any choice if you don't want to spend a lot of time to make it work. Best example -- change backup location. It should take like 30 min to implement the custom path, 2-3 blocks of code, but you need to tinker with symlinks...

3254,gb67vf,Do you have apps open in the background that may be using your microphone?,,2
3255,gb67vf,"Here are a few methods to distinguish if your device has been compromised.

1. Firstly, just as a precautionary measure make sure you don‚Äôt have apps such as TeamViewer Quick Support which is often used by malicious third parties to record / share your screen with them. 

Next, the most most likely way is by installing a profile on your device 

2. Go to Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management 

(a) now if you see Profiles & Device Management it means there is a profile on your device and you can delete it from here 

(b) you don‚Äôt see the option for Profiles & Device Management which means you don‚Äôt have a profile installed on your device 

3. Now since we know there isn‚Äôt any profile let‚Äôs make sure your device isn‚Äôt jailbroken. The easiest method is to update your device to the latest version of iOS currently iOS 13.4.1 

(a) you see the update and install it successfully. Means you aren‚Äôt jailbroken.

(b) you can‚Äôt see or install the update means someone has either jailbroken your device or you need to reinstall iOS to clear up a bug / glitch.

4. Next make sure that your account hasn‚Äôt been compromised. Change your password on your iCloud Account. Do so by using a complex password and make it as long as possible (long passwords are more secure than short complex ones). Use a password manager in order to make it easier to remember them. You can find apples build in password manager in Setting > Passwords & accounts > Website & App passwords. 




These are all the methods that someone can try to comprise your device if you don‚Äôt have any rest assured your device hasn‚Äôt been compromised. I came up with these since my dad is constantly paranoid that he‚Äôs being watched and I tried to help eliminate those suspicions to no avail. But I hope this helps you at least.",,2
