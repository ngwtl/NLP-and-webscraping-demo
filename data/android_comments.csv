Google also mandates that all units that sold 100k devices get the updates released until 18mos after launch, so most units will get almost 2 years security updates.

[The efficiency of exynos can vary per phone (example)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s8/how-to/exynos-chip-binning-t3596434), some chips are only able to operate on a less efficient Adaptive Supply Voltage group and version. The efficiency of cellular can vary other than ASV. This means subjective experiences might vary. Exynos being inferior to Snapdragon refers specifically to the S20, it can also vary for Snapdragon (e.g. Snapdragon 810).

Heat is generated when calculations are performed. If lots of calculations for the chip are performed (compiling, rendering, transcoding, gaming ); any chip will heat.

The calculating chip may slow down to increase its efficiency. On Samsungs this is mostly the Game Optimizing Service. It can be configured e.g. with Game Launcher.

I don't know what Nokia uses.

Samsung uses their own SmartSwitch backup which also has the ability to backup documents and other files in your downloads folder and such. I believe Huawei and Sony does as well, but they're different from each other.

Always back up important files, it takes 20 seconds.

My point is (and I'm not being mean, I'm making the point so you remember it and never make this mistake again) is if you consider something ""important"" then you make a back up of it incase this happens.

Forget what Nokia told you or what you did, I'm talking about before you had any issues with your device.
Did you make a regular back up to Google drive of your files?

If you didn't back up those ""important"" files then you really got no need or right to complain.
If you considered those files not important enough to back up, then they were not that important to you.

You've just got to go into your device settings once a week or once a month or how ever frequently you feel is necessary, and hit the back up button.
Select Google drive as the destination folder and it's done, it takes less than a minute.
This also avoids the need for you to make angry and frustrated posts here very upset you lost your files.

They aren't taught how things work anymore, just the surface level of this is what you do to activate this.

Other way around is the same, copy the file, tap on ""sd storage"" even if you can already see the folder it will got to beneath it, do not tap the folder, tap the storage first until on the right side you see all folders on that storage, then tap the folder and now it shouldn't be greyed out anymore.

1. A cold boot is doing a lot, so anything optional that can be pushed off it to make it faster is a win. Blue light filter would definitely be something not immediately vital to startup.
2. Security. Anybody can boot a phone. Only the owner should be able to unlock it. Fingerprint readers are hilariously insecure, so the phone forces a pin or password because its higher security. Always On Display could also show personal info, so its best to make sure the right user has unlocked the phone before displaying. 
3. Permissions. Apps have permissions too, so only certain ones can be run during startup. If the developer didn't put in a System App permission or something like that, it likely can't be run until the device unlocks.

His device has a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip but get droid tip state MTK tools should be used.
That is insane - you never use MTK tools on a Qualcomm chip device.

Obviously if you choose to ignore xda and go elsewhere you do so at your own risk, but in my experience, ignoring XDA and doing something else usually ends in tears.

Havoc 3.5 is not available for your device yet and neither is lineage OS 17.1 probably because it's difficult to get android 10 working on your device.

You are unfortunately going to have to wait until those ROMs become available, or accept the fact android 10 ROMs may not ever come.

I also suggest you don't do anything if you don't understand the terminology or instructions.
It's really not worth messing up your device and I really don't want to see anyone have that happen to them.",,1
390,hatx0p,"If the roms you want are not yet available I don't think your device will get them.

XDA is the only place to go for afterlife development and if there is no one in the community interested in getting android 10 ROMs onto your device, they are not going to happen.
I'm not sure android 10 is that easy for your device, if it was, then it would have already happened.

So right now your either got to use older custom ROMs, wait for a developer to work on a new android 10 ROM or forget the whole thing and move on.

Just a word of advice.

If you don't understand anything you read on XDA, forget flashing any ROMs or doing anything to your device.

Too many people go rushing into flashing ROMs or unlocking bootloaders without understanding or even reading the instructions provided and end up posting here crying the following day begging people to help them fix their bricked device.

I'm not being mean, but I don't want you to become another statistic.
If you yourself are now admitting you don't understand what you are reading I strongly urge you not to do anything and forget the whole thing, only because I don't want to see you mess up your device because you don't understand what to do.
If you don't understand anything, there's a huge risk of you messing everything up and leaving your device completely knackered and unusable, which I don't want to see or encourage.

I'm using devices that are ""A only"" partition and like you, I've got several years experience of flashing custom ROMs on several devices (mostly Samsung and Motorola)

With the advent of project treble and GSIs even Ive found the process of flashing ROMs and disabling force encryption daunting, confusing and quite difficult.
The worst offender for is Motorola - now owned by Lenovo.
The last two Motorola device I had were extremely difficult to flash and get a GSI to even boot.
This process was not made any easier by confusing, contradicting and difficult to follow instructions and yes I'm referring to xda.

I mean no offense by suggesting the process may be beyond your abilities.
I personally found the process far to complex and fraught with problems that I simply gave up and left my last Moto running pie when there are several good android 10 GSIs for it.

I have used roms with Samsung j1 nxt, Xiaomi note 6a, Asus zenfone max pro m1....none of them gave me this much trouble like my recent 2 phones, realme 3i(that phone doesn't allow bootloader to be unlocked) and this Lenovo z5...

1) Relax, there's no point getting stressed about mails. Everything and everyone can wait 20 min. Otherwise they would phone you instead of mailing you.

443,haqzeq,"Install FairEmail from F-droid.org (to preventing it from depending on google play services, so if the delay be because of google play services, it won't affect this time) 

Also i suggest you to install F-droid app so you be sure that you always have latest version of FairEmail. (also do the steps below to F-droid app so it can run automatically and check new versions or make sure you manually tap on update repes button and then check updates tab to be sure you always have latest version of FairEmail)

Then create an app password in your account and login with it with the app. (i suggest to enable 2 step verification before this step if you didn't it)

Then exclude FairEmail from battery optimizations and allow it to have unrestricted data access.

Also if you have a phone with strict battery saving behavior like huawei make sure to set FairEmail to manual and enable all options for it in 
- battey > app launch
section. (auto start, run in background and etc)

Also exclude it from auto battery optimizations in samsung or smart battery saver in android pie.

+ go to its settings and set the app to check Emails more frequently although it will use more battery.

Also i suggest you to enable  hardned ssl if you have a famous Email service that you are sure that it supports new TLS security protocols. (Microsoft and Google are OK) so your account be more secure.

Much better spec sheet for the price,,2

Here's a comparison: have 2 of the same phone in my family, both the same age. I charge mine 3-4 times a day (or more) between 25 and 85%. The other one is charged 1.5 times a day (once in the morning and maybe a top up in the afternoon, but not usually). Mine runs multiple sync jobs, moves a lot of data, etc.

Don't rely on your phone as a primary save device for everything. If you are lucky you should be able to get in through Google just hit forgot password",,4
572,hagdi8,"Go to your carrier. Tell them your phnoe broke and the sim broke too. They will give you your sim back. ( same number same all just different actual chip ). Then put the sim in your new/old phone. Insert sim in your device and if it s an older phone, factory reset it, if it s new then just insert the sim and set it up. When google asks you to set up your google account, put your email and press ""forgot password"", then you will be prompted with multiple options to retrieve your account. Google automatically backs up your apps contacts messages and settings. So retrieving you Google Account would be your best bet.

Tips to help you prevent this in the future:

\- although I do not recommend this write you pasword on a piece of paper and put it somewhere like behing a magnet on a refrigirator, or behind a frame or something, this way you rememebr to associate the given object with your password.

\- When making a new password, write it down on a piece of paper next to your nightstand and for a week, every time you go to sleep, just set yourself a goal to say your password out loud 30 times. If you do this for a week, you will remember your password.

\- Use google photos for unlimited high quality photo backup. As the sentence suggests it backs up ALL your photos to your google account for free.

\-Make a slightly different password for every site. I am not ging to expect you to remember 20 different password, but create a ""master password"" like. If your name is Emily Baker and you were born in 1999 on the 2nd of january. set a semi-complicated password like Em0201Ba99ker1999. For every site like Facebook, at the end of your password ad a suffix like ""fb"", for Snapchat add ""sc"", for twitter add ""tt"", for reddit add ""rd"". or something to remember the app by, this way you only have to remember your master password and then remember which suffix you chose.

\-never store important data locally, unless you have to identical hard drivees which you copy to each other every few months, then do NOT store data locally. Your phone can break, your hard drive WILL break at some point. Always store photos on goolge photos. For every other files there are stuff like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. You can even do something like create a telegram account and make yourself a server which you can make private and post different kind of files.

Having the source means (in theory) you could build your own copy from that source and deploy it to your phone. However, then you have to trust the toolchain - compilers, etc. And the compiler *they* used. And so on.

Among other things, discovery of something like this would cause significant social backlash, possible de-listing, or even removal from devices.

When it comes to *features*, one thing you could do is build a copy and compare it to what's in that version in the play store. If they differ, then you know something fishy is going on. But malware goes out of its way to be non-obvious.

I thought this is for new phones with high specs as they are now smarter and will manage your battery and ram themselves and closing them yourself will just make it harder for the phone like it stresses the CPU, double the ram usage, consume more battery and make your phone slower?",,1
685,ha4fxx,"Absolutely nothing to do with specs. It's all about software. Android is built the same for ALL phone regardless of specs. Sometimes manufacturers like Samsung will add on their own stuff but under the hood it's the same whether you're running a Pixel 3XL or some cheap Samsung you got. As long as they run the right version of android, it'll be OK.

I can't see which version of Android it was introduced on but I can see it existed in 2016 at least. I didn't google that hard but I quickly found an article explaining android self managing this. Which was Android Nougat or Android 7.0 (we're on 11 currently). However it could have been years before that. 

The thing is. Android manages stuff in the background. It'll freeze apps so they won't run stuff. But if you go back to it, it starts where you left off. Starting up apps takes more effort than just continuing. It's like picking up a book with a bookmark, you just open the page where you were at instead of trying to figure out and getting to where you were before which takes time and effort. Apps have to go through their startup process, log in, do whatever they do and then you can go but they YOU might need to get back to the point where you were or whatever. All takes you time which is more for the CPU and RAM to do and especially the battery.

There's also going to be some apps that need to perpetually run in the background and killing them just forces them to restart. Like facebook, you might have it set to see where you are, send notification etc. Even closing the app won't stop those and something needs to run. So closing it doesn't do much if anything but make it resart and go to more effort to find where it was.

And again. Whether you have a big flagship or a cheap budget phone. As long as they're on the same operating system or relevent ones. It's pretty pointless. Unless you're running Android v2.4 or something ancient. I still kill my apps from time to time if they're misbehaving. A recent BaconReader update (Reddit App) has seen a video keep playing in the background, I can go to another app or leave the post but I can still hear it. Killing it stops that.",,5

First, if you flash a different distribution of Android, some of them allow you to skip installing the Google apps. Also, Samsung have their own versions of many Google Android apps, so even out of the box you can avoid some of it.

Email (the phone's ""accounts"" settings page should support all of these):

* Hotmail
* Yahoo
* Outlook
* Host-your-own (probably cost a small fee for hosting; you will need to know some technical detail to set it up with your phone)

* Amazon",,11

r/privacy and r/fossdroid have extensive posts about switching away from Google to alternatives.

Google will still want you to add a google account to your phone in the wizard, but it is possible to skip. It is possible to create a google account with a non-google email address; you don't actually need a gmail account for that.

811,h9dtpe,"I've been asking myself the same question, i still don't have a full answer but, if you really want to use Android without some form of Google spying on you, i suggest the following. If you can, maybe you can try this:

1) download a **custom ROM** or AOSP (without the Gapps or Google services) for the note 9 

   ***(i have yet to try it myself on my note 9)*** 

2) download **F-droid**, install it (it's a FOSS based app store)

3) download **Aurora store** from F-droid, install it (it goes into google play store , using a spoof account or anonymously) 

Downside of Aurora store is that apps you've download from it, won't allow you the ability to make in-app purchases. 

downside of not having google play services (if i'm not mistaken -- correct me if i'm wrong yeah) is that you can't use GPS , you can't use push mail from gmail. 

alternatively, you can get one of those Linux-based phones, but to me, it's still in its infancy stage and well, it has a long way to go. Good concept, but i see not much support for it...unfortunately.",,2

Everyone are trying to escape from google.

So where you want to go?
another big tech company like Apple, Microsoft? 

Or some untrustworthy names that can be even more dangerous if they know your sensitive data than google because at least google won't try to help thieves or such with your data!

What you should do is not escaping from google.

Just disable google assistant, deny sensitive google play service permissions like mic and camera and body sensors (if you don't use a fitness tracking app that relies on it.)

Disable all usage stat permissions that you can live without in apps > special access.

If you can, disable google apps and use alternatives.

For ex.  you can check your emails with FairEmail or K-9 or AquaMail instead of official GMail and Microsoft apps.

You can use protonmail, protoncalendar and in the future protondrive instead of their equivalent google services.

You can use bitwarden, standard notes, joplin, evernote and such instead of keep and google password manager.

You can use firefox that they are trying to by far pushing it in the performance aspect and also have great privacy and purpose.

And also disable tracking features that you don't want in your google account settings. (for ex. I need youtube but not others)

But I'm writing this to recommend you to stop using free VPNs. They (the free ones) are usually known to use your phone (or PC or any device they're installed on) to route internet traffic from other people through your phone and your WiFi, consuming you bandwidth. Idk if they also do other not-so-great things, but usually free VPNs should at least be used with caution and the least times possible because of that.

This could be caused by a software bug in the coding of Twitter, your VPN, or in Android itself (especially if you updated your phone recently and a big went unnoticed).

The fast battery drain is a little concerning and what leads me to believe there could be an issue with your battery. But all batteries degrade over time and some fail rapidly and can display behavior like this. However it is not out of the question that quick battery drain can be caused by a software issue too.

I would just continue to use your phone like normal. If you notice your battery doesn't last as long or continues to do this, you may want to try factory resetting. Same if it keeps crashing. If the problem persists, consider taking your phone to an expert and they can replace the battery if you need or pinpoint the issue in software and hopefully fix it. 

I would not be very concerned about your phone being hacked. The only way this really happens is if you downloaded some file from a shady website and then executed it. Being hacked simply from watching a video on Twitter is very very unlikely.

Disregard. Looks like the S9 family does have TWRP available. 

A custom ROM is an option but you lose Samsung Pay and(?) Google Pay.

It's certainly an option but not required and I see where you're going. Custom ROMs are a rabbit hole I no longer go down. I hate dirty flashing, even with ROMs like former CyanogenMod/Lineage. 

I think it may be worth evaluating if this was more than a hiccup. But personally (and I am an Android enthusiast) would advise against custom ROMs, even reputable/established ones.",,2
936,h94xua,"As the saying goes, ""if it's free, you're the product"".

Whether it be your data or something more sinister, 'free' comes at a cost and isn't always the best option. The amount of downloads is not anywhere near as important as the reviews and app policies. Everyone wants something free.

 I recommend private tunnel VPN. Good speeds. Inexpensive at $6 monthly. Not #1 for privacy but my preferred choice for Android. If you want something good for free most of the top VPNs offer a 7 day trial. Some require you make an account, some don't.",,2

940,h94xua,"It doesn't seem the most reputable but does not come across as malicious either. The website location does match that of the developers contact information. Also none of the negative reviews I've read indicate any sort of abuse. It also has the fact of being on the Play Store since 2018. That doesn't mean much as malicious things do go unnoticed on the play store but gives it at least some credibility. 

I'm no security expert but Overall I think you should be fine. If you did an Antivirus scan and that didn't find anything either it's very unlikely and your OS just experienced a hiccup. 

Just keep an eye out for other odd behavior or random reboots. 

You can use Tasker to create a task to let you know if your device reboots or there is a very (by today's standards) primitive app by developer Defim that I used for years called Whole Ready that still works.

I completely understand and respect people have privacy concerns, but what your post is explaining is completely unfounded and what you said you have read is not true.

1. No one can remotely root your tablet, it's not possible, so calm down, it's not been rooted.
Root needs the bootloader to be unlocked, so you are honestly expecting us all to believe your fear your tablet had been bootloader unlocked *as well* as rooted?
Pull the other one, it's not happened, I can garuntee it.

2. I've not rooted any android device since 2017, and every device I've had since 2017 has had *two* data folders.
Every android device has two data folders.
One in data and one in android / data.
Perfectly normal.
What you read about two data folders only being seen on rooted devices is completely false, total trash and caused you to get triggered over nothing.

I'm especially annoyed because this is now the fifth post you have made regarding this issue, you've posted in places you shouldn't have posted and you've had your post removed three times, and your original post is still live, just no one has bothered to comment, but here you are again, complaining about your fears, which are completely unfounded and totally rediculous.

If you are so concerned about this issue, just factory reset the bloody tablet and start a fresh and be done with it.
It's not difficult.

I also suggest you don't believe everything you read on line and you stop getting so worked up and upset to the point you feel the need to make five identical posts about Samsung's and androids perfectly normal file system, especially with what's going on in the world right now.
Life is far too short to worry about data folders or ghost rooting.
Get over it.

I've reported this post for two reasons.

1. being repetitive - you've already made four other identical posts.

2. This post is Completely unnecessary because the original is still ""live"" just no one has replied to it, probably because everyone thinks it's silly.

I'm sorry to be so blunt but sometimes it's the best way to deal with this.

Bixby is nothing to do with your apps appearing on the home screen only or where they all go.

3. Change Magsik Manager package name. Go to Magisk Manager > three lines > settings > ""Hide Magisk Manager"" then follow the steps.
4. If your banking app still thinks you have root priviliges then do this. ( This will wipe data so back up ). Search on youtube: how to flash stock firmware for oneplus devices.

But from your own screenshots, it's definitely running a 32bit version of Android.

Unfortunately, such devices cannot run 64 bit versions of Android but you have an even bigger problem.
Cricket do not allow any of their devices to be bootloader unlocked, so even if there was a way to flash a 64 bit version of Android via a custom ROM (and there's not) you can't unlock the bootloader on your device to even attempt such.
There's no workaround.

I'm sorry to say you are currently ""out of luck"" with this device, and please don't be afraid to ask such questions, as there's been a flood of posts about 32 bit devices since Pokémon go announced this change.

Arm 32 bit versions are eventually going to be phased out completely anyway, so you could see this as an early opertunity to change devices.

Little bit of advice - As you live in the US, do not buy devices locked to a US network, as they may be cheaper in the short term but you give up any right to customise the device later on as all network locked devices in the US cannot be bootloader unlocked, so custom ROMs and root will be impossible.
There's no hacks or workarounds either.

Also avoid ALL US Snapdragon chipped Samsungs - especially the A10 and A10E (they are both 32 bit) as they cannot be bootloader unlocked either, and European / Chinese Exynos chipped Samsung's WILL NOT WORK in USA.

The best cheap 64 bit devices available these days are the Moto G7 Power, the Moto E6 plus, Nokia 2.3 and 5.3 and the Xiaomi Redmi 8 - all under £150 in uk ($188)

No, sorry.  If you want to record phone calls, you need to give the application permissions to write to your storage.

1214,h8fuxp,"Qualcomm doesn't have a monopoly. Other mobile chipset manufacturers include Mediatek, Samsung, Huawei and Apple. 

There are many reasons why Qualcomm chipsets are predominant in the US. One reason is that the US has CDMA cellular networks (Verizon and Sprint), while most other countries use only GSM networks. Qualcomm holds patents related to CDMA. Once CDMA networks are retired, which will happen over the next few years, then there may be more competition.

Qualcomm chipsets also happen to provide a good balance of performance, cost, and battery life.",,3
1215,h8fuxp,"The costs are prohibitive. Nothing is 'keeping' another company from entering the market, but the costs are astronomical. Plus the big boys already have deals in place with the fabs to actually manufacturer the chips, and they get top billing in regards to their place in line.

Intel has their own fabs, and it would be great if they would make a solid push into the mobile space. However they can't seem to get their shit together (14+++++++ nm die process).",,2
1216,h8fuxp,"Samsung is working with AMD to produce even better mobile processors, but we won't see those for awhile",,1
1217,h8fuxp,"> What's to stop phone manufacturers from making their own processors

Nothing, but why put the effort in when Qualcomm already makes good products? Samsung has Exynos but they don't even release those variants in North America for some reason.

MediaTek and HiSilicon also make mobile SoCs but in general they suck compared to Qualcomm offerings and most people in North America aren't fans of Chinese smartphone products because they are linked to spying.",,1
1218,h8fuxp,"Here's one reason:
""Estimates put the cost of building a new fab over one billion U.S. dollars with values as high as $3–4 billion not being uncommon. TSMC invested $9.3 billion in its Fab15 300 mm wafer manufacturing facility in Taiwan. The same company estimations suggest that their future fab might cost $20 billion.""

On top of that is the R&D, engineering, etc. So even if you outsourced manufacturing to someone like TSMC it's expensive to jump in the market and get to that point.",,1
1219,h8fuxp,"So basically it's cheaper than making your own processor? That makes me curious why Samsung almost never uses Exynos in their US variants, even though international models do.",,1
1220,h8fuxp,"MTK SOCs are great for low cost phones, they are pretty good with open source I believe.",,1
1221,h8fuxp,"Because to put Exynos in US phones they have to pay for Qualcomm antennae for CDMA compatibility. Why spend for an Exynos chip+Qualcomm antenna, when you can just spend for a Qualcomm chip with the integrated antenna tech? The only time they put Exynos in a US phone was for the S6 because the Snapdragon 810 was such a fire in a way worse than the Exynos 990 is today. Snapdragon did bounce back beautifully though.",,1

1284,h8akfh,"Lol I can relate to the Ritalin and long paragraphs of typing. I'm prescribed Adderall myself and I've had times where I'm texting a friend shortly after taking my meds and soon enough I'm going on essay-level tangents about something. 

I've been using Android since I got my first smartphone, and I strongly prefer it. I've tried an iPhone and I don't think I could ever switch to it because they lack so many things on Android that I find to be essential. 

That being said, I can honestly understand why a lot of people favor iPhones. I've always been around more tech savvy people in my life, among my friends and family the vast majority of them are fairly competent with technology, even the less inclined people I know are very familiar with the basics and know their way around their phones/computers at a basic level. The thing is, after working electronics retail I realised how far from the norm that is. The vast majority of people don't care about their tech, they just want to call, text, video call, listen to music and go social media, and they don't want to replace the thing unless they absolutely have to because it doesn't interest them, they just wanna buy one that will continue to function for years because they don't WANT a new one and in general they aren't going to be excited for most new features aside from cameras looking better. 

iPhones provide exactly that. They're simple to use and you basically can't fuck them up or make it do something you don't want it to do accidentally. They also tend to last a long time, so while they're more expensive up front they tend to still work fairly well for years. I've seen people still using an iPhone 6s and even once saw someone still using their iPhone 4 and they ran pretty smoothly still. I'm sure they needed a battery replacement at some point but they otherwise still kept up and didn't feel sluggish. 

Reddit in general consists of more nerds, its just the nature of it considering it's a social media platform that's centered around topics instead of the users. especially on this subreddit, you're not gonna find many of the average users who just want a working phone, you're going to see the users who look into these things more in depth, comparing screen refresh rates in Hz and battery capacities in mAh, things that your average user won't know, or even generally won't care about. if you ask an average person what it means to have a screen run in 90Hz they'll look at you like you just asked them to describe nuclear physics. And that's not even a bad thing, necessarily, they're just not nerds, they don't care about these things, they just want their phone to work. You're not going to win these people over by telling them how great the customization is and how you can set different apps as your default because they won't understand why you'd go out of your way to download a different web browser or messaging app than the one that comes with your phone. 

Most of what Android does better are things that average users would never bother with and Apple has done a great job at making, and marketing their devices to users who just generally aren't super into technology. And when an iPhone user does try an Android, since they hear Android is so much cheaper, they go with a budget model of something like a Motorola, or a 4-5 generations old Samsung, and when it turns out to be terrible, they assume that's the Android experience as a whole and not just that they bought a shitty phone because unlike iPhones, Android isn't really standardized in any way. The latest Pixel and latest Galaxy will be very different from one another in tons of ways and if you don't research you won't know what ways that is, and oftentimes this group of people isn't interested enough to research, they want what they know works for them and they want what they know they like 

I guess my point is, you're probably not going to actually convince any of these people of anything unless they're nerds for technology because for them it boils down to: easy to use, good camera, iMessage, and it looks nice. That's it. I gave up on that whole argument years ago when I realized I'm just not the target audience for an iPhone, they're made with the average user in mind first and foremost. And anyone giving you shit for what kind of phone you have is either immature or intensely shallow so they're not worth your time anyways",,2
1285,h8akfh,"Wow, t'is quite the wall of text!

There are many shortcomings in ios that would annoy me, like the lack of customizability and not having a file manager for a long time.

E.g: No access to the actual settings via the quick settings menu? Really?

1293,h8akfh,Interesting..,,1
1294,h8akfh,"I see. OP - if you like Android, just get it and don’t worry about what other people think?

There are a ton of articles and forum posts here and everywhere (basically) that outlines the the pros and cons of each platform. Still, if your goal is to prove to your friends that Android is better than iPhone (when they are already committed to iPhone) that might drive a wedge in your friendship. I’m not a big fan of group messages so I don’t get the hype around iMessage. I use an iPhone and when I message someone on Android it sent via SMS — that isn’t a big deal.",,2
1295,h8akfh,">Dam that's long

Yeah, amusingly the Adderall ramblings that I mentioned in the first line happened here lmao got a little carried away but theres just a lot of little things that are all small realisations on the topic that I've had.

 I used to feel apple stuff was just overpriced garbage and that people using it were stupid for paying a premium just to have something that does less than I got for less money, but in reality it's just that their devices are quite good for their intended audience and as far as phones are concerned I've just never been in that category. 

Amusingly I've actually started to come to like some of Apple's products and software a lot once I started using them. As a pet project I converted my PC to a dual-boot Windows/Hackintosh, originally because I felt I'll likely need to learn to use Apple stuff for my career and it would be good to have hands on experience, and I actually ended up liking the OS a lot, which lead to me getting an iPad and apple pencil and also loving those. 
As far as phones though, I won't be switching to an iPhone without some serious changes being made to iOS that I just can't see happening and I have a OnePlus 7 Pro that they'll have to pry from my cold dead hands lmao. It's gonna take a seriously impressive phone even on Android's side of things to get me to switch from this thing

>I like building pcs and technology and phones and all the around but have pretty much nobody to talk to about it.

I totally get that, it sucks to not be able to really share your hobbies and passions as much with your friends and people around you but if you look in the right places you can definitely meet like-minded people to talk about these things with",,1
1296,h8akfh,"I don't get the whole deal with this  iMessage. is it instead of whatsapp? 

like, all the people I know only use whatsapp.. I don't think anyone knows what is even iMessage.. (In my area) 

&#x200B;

Anyway thanks sir",,0
1297,h8akfh,"Yeah, iMessage is the USA version of Whatsapp. On an iPhone, if you are texting other iPhone users, you can chat over iMessage. This means that you get Whatsapp-like features (end-to-end encryption, reactions, read receipts, etc) on those chats. When you send a message to someone else with iMessage, the speech bubble color of your chat is blue. If they don't have an iPhone, the color will be green (indicating SMS). The issue with that is SMS is an inferior experience than iMessage, and many android users are discriminated against due to the ""green bubble"".

Since SMS has been unlimited in the United States (unlike other countries where it's been more expensive), it's stuck around as the norm. Since iPhone users now can chat over iMessage on top of SMS, there's really no reason for them to download another app. Even though Android users have more chat apps, iPhone users don't.

My philosophy on the whole Android-vs-iOS thing is this: People can buy and use whatever phone they want--it's not up to me to dictate what they want. However, discriminating against people with other operating systems is wrong. It's happened to me several times that someone tries to text me and says ""Oh, you don't have an iPhone"". If others don't like the standard SMS experience, either download and use another chat app (Whatsapp, Instagram DMs, Signal, GroupMe, etc) or stop complaining. Nobody should feel bad about the phone they bought.",,1
1298,h8akfh,"Pretty much but 2 corrections: iMessage and SMS always have worked in concert on the platform. When sending a message if iMessage isn’t available, it has always fallen back to SMS (for phone numbers as addresses).

Also, iOS has every chat app that I know about. What messenger app is it missing? WhatsApp, facebook messenger, google hangouts, Microsoft teams, etc etc etc are all on iOS.",,1
1299,h8akfh,"Yeah--I think that seamless integration is part of the problem. Since texting someone with iMessage is the exact same process as texting someone with SMS (i.e. open the Messages app and type in a phone number), the attitude has shifted. People have come to expect iMessage features everywhere (because they are integrated into the normal texting experience) and that causes them to discriminate against Android users.

As far as other apps goes, it is true that alternate, cross-platform chat apps exist on both sides. However, it's not a tech problem anymore--it's a social one. Getting people to download and use a new chat app sounds a little rude (i.e. ""You have to download an entirely new app just for the privilege of messaging me"") and most iPhone will say that ""normal texting just works"". While other chat apps do exist, people just don't want to download them.",,1
1300,h8a1b9,I have mine set to when using app only. I can't see any reason why they need constant knowledge of my actual location.,,2
1301,h8a1b9,"Location is usually only used for finding ATMs, to my knowledge.",,2
1302,h8a1b9,"Thanks! I also think the same. I changed it to ""only when app is opened"", everything seems fine for now.",,1
1303,h8a0l2,"No, it is not possible to leak passwords. Modern websites use HTTPS for secure login and communication.",,1
1304,h89z09,"The permission for an app on the phone to pause can be revoked with the PC program ADB.

adb shell cmd appops set com.google.android.youtube TAKE_AUDIO_FOCUS ignore

ignore or deny, the default is allow. The app might not work correctly.

In this example, com.google.android.youtube is obtained by clicking share on the playstore on YouTube. This is the internal name of the app which is used there.

An alternative would be the Samsung Sound Assistant → Dual App Sound or Multi Sound",,1
1305,h89nex,I think it does.,,1
1306,h89nex,"Ironically, usually unlocked ones get updates earlier, while carriers gatekeep newer versions for whatever reason they're doing that.

I've also read, that some manufacturers may not provide you an update as soon as it's out so that their servers won't overload, you're not in control of this.",,1
1307,h89fl8,Did you try clearing the browser cache and such?,,1
1308,h89fl8,"Ok I'm sorry for wasting time for such a simple thing, i thought it was a device issue not browser. Thank you!",,1
1309,h89epk,"For the IMEI number, go to the phone dialer and dial *#06# or find the about phone section in the settings(unless that was where you already looked).

It is also possible that the SIM card failed or has been dislodged. Try powering off the phone, taking out the SIM card and reinserting the SIM card. If the SIM card failed, it will need replaced.",,1
1310,h89epk,"When I dialed the code you gave me I received a message saying ""IMEI null"" 

Im guessing a new SIM or upgrade in phone will be in order.",,2
1311,h89epk,"Thank you.  I will do what you suggested first. 

I don't know how I can access the SIM when the battery cant be removed so I don't know how to get inside where it is.",,1
1312,h89epk,"If tampering might be a possibility, your phone could be in field test mode.

Try this, in the dialer type *#197328640# or \*#*#197328640#\*\#*

If you get a prompt then select ""common"" it is usually option 6 and then find FTM probably option 1.

If FTM is on, then turn it off and restart the phone. Check if your IMEI number is back.",,1
1313,h89epk,"Thank you. No success but I appreciate giving it a go. This is so peculiar and absurdly random. The only rational  answer I have is my sibling and possibly her bf were on it whilst with my mum. I can always tell. 

Perhaps the wisest choice is putting her on my plan with a basic mobile keeping it locked to high heaven. 

I just cant believe something (to me) so complicated occurred out of nowhere and months of no problems. But alas, everything has glitches I suppose. 

I appreciate your intelligence in trying to help and kindness 

Thank you",,1
1314,h88v2u,"Probably a degraded battery, I've had this issue on most of my phone's after a year or two.",,1
1315,h88v2u,"I forgot to mention that my Vivo XI+ was like this since the first day I bought it. I'm not really a mobile gamer and I used my phone to text, call and browse social media. I never returned it because I lost the receipt for it but I recently just found it, lol.",,1

1363,h82wuo,"Boy, where do we draw the line, right?

*Technically*, SMS is a feature of the management portion of the cell network frames, so no, you can't get SMS without a Sim (but only because the sim provides the account/phone # info, the hardware is still transmitting frames, so an SMS could still be sent).

Then we get to these services, which provide a bridge from an IP based app to the SMS system.

Get over it, your fears are completely unfounded if you plan to use a third party launcher.

Pros of the S10 Lite:

If you use TWS or other Bluetooth earphones primarily then the lack of headphone jack and larger battery help with the Bluetooth connection. If you have issues with your palm accidentally pressing the screen (if you have smaller hands maybe) then the flat screen could help

Pros of the S10 Plus:
If you're often around environments where water or dust is a concern, then the IP rating could be very beneficial. If you're an audiophile then the headphone jack is definitely going to be a benefit with Samsung's SoundAlive and it has a more than decent DAC. 

For screen resolution I would say it's personal preference. Having used larger screen and bezelless phones for a while, I personally don't notice the difference in resolution on anything above 720p unless going from 1080p to 4k.

Android Smartphones always have some Pre-installed apps which you cannot Uninstall or disable and at some point you end up clicking those icons and then it starts loading. It annoys me alot! 
This post will help you to deal with this problem 


1. Download [App Inspector ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.projectoria.appinspector) app from playstore and locate the apps which you want to remove. Tap on it and you will see the package name of that app. Note down the package name somewhere on a paper. You will need it later on.

2. Download Platform tools and ADB Drivers of your phone on pc.
     i) :- [Plat form tools ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hBMnPhiaSXLDwpsJ2xgW3msevj2Dqpr/view?usp=drivesdk)

     ii) [Universal ADB Drivers ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dTgIS1Ys_uB0DmsTq27dvMaIKFaaepn/view?usp=drivesdk)

3. Enable USB Debugging on your phone. 

4. Connect your phone to your pc via a USB cable and locate ADB Driver folder which you downloaded earlier and run Universal ADB Driver app. It will automatically detect your phone. Now install USB Drivers. 

5. Now go to platform tools folder and open command prompt window here. 

6. Now enter the following commands and after each command press Enter. 
   i) adb devices 
   ii) adb shell
   iii) pm uninstall -k --user 0 name of package

Note :- replace ' name of package' with the package name which you have noted at the 1st step. 

7. By now you would have able to remove the system apps.

Feature wise the Pixel and OnePlus are slightly ahead of the Z4 (which is the most expensive), but I personally prefer Moto's ambient display over the Pixel. (Haven't used the OnePlus, but I don't think AMOLED lets you use ambient display?) And the Pixel is noticeably smaller than the other two. The Pixel's camera is probably the best of the three, yet has the lowest resolution if you're a pixel-counter. The OnePlus in several areas is the best (highest test scores on things like graphics performance, processor speed, battery) but the Pixel is cheaper and isn't that far behind.",,1

The G8+ should have some pretty great battery life if that's a major concern and a fairly clean build of Android (stock with some nice features). Also has some great audio quality

The Z4 is the one I wouldn't recommend off the list. It's kind of a jack of all trades, but not as good in any area as the others, with everything it does well, another of your choices does better and more 

The Pixel will have the best camera and be supported the longest + monthly security patches. If you can get it, I'd recommend trying to find the XL model though, as the 3 was notably lacking in the battery life department

The 6T is phenomenal software wise with a decent update schedule and can use GCam to take some pretty great photos. Oxygen OS usually has a great battery life as well and under display fingerprint scanners are really convenient

3. Enable USB Debugging on your phone. 

4. Connect your phone to your pc via a USB cable and locate ADB Driver folder which you downloaded earlier and run Universal ADB Driver app. It will automatically detect your phone. Now install USB Drivers. 

5. Now go to platform tools folder and open command prompt window here. 

6. Now enter the following commands and after each command press Enter. 
   i) adb devices 
   ii) adb shell
   iii) pm uninstall -k --user 0 name of package

Note :- replace ' name of package' with the package name which you have noted at the 1st step. 

7. By now you would have able to remove the system apps. 

8. If you still have some confusion you can watch my YouTube video on it. Hope this information helps you.

Ooo! You are studying Computer Engineering? Maybe they will teach you, someday, the difference between *memory* (RAM) and *mass storage.* This is a concept we learned in **8th grade Math class. In the 1970s.**

At least, ""Cache are the files that apps downloads to speed up the performance,"" has some potentially true information in it. First, ""cache"" is not a plural word. A program's (app's) cache **is** composed of files used by the program, which yes, might have been downloaded by the app. The files are also *created* by the app.

In larger computers, like a desktop or notebook PC, program cache will be stored in RAM. This is why it helps to have several GB of RAM. I have never written or studied Android programs (apps). Still, I have no doubt they are capable of storing information temporarily in memory (RAM). However, recent Android devices might have as little as 1GB of RAM, as opposed to 4GB or more on a PC. So there is precious little room there to store information.

I can go on, but right now I'm deciding where to post something I already wrote. Don't come at me with this, ""Stop spreading false information,"" garbage.",,0

To reiterate: this is clearly, undeniably, *demonstrably* false.

Normally I would say you should always have a solid PC at home but Qualcomm has a great monopoly on arm processors right now and are producing some great hardware that is compatible to a PC. Some Microsoft surface tablets currently use arm processors. 

I mean obviously the TDPs are lower, and you can't maintain maximum clockspeed for more then like 5 minutes on a snapdragon but it's getting there. Occulus vr (Facebook) has a product that uses a snapdragon 835 which is a couple generation's old now. Traditionally you need a $1000 PC to play vr, but the lighter titles seem to work just fine on a arm processor.

edit2: okay also if u set a tab to desktop view and then open a page from the same site in a dif tab, its in mobile view so this is dumb af. fr this shit woulda been so easy for devs to problem-solve wtf.

""enable double tap zoom for mobile sites""

""make this particular site always default to desktop view""

""default all mobile sites to desktop view""

three checkbox settings that r far from difficult to implement unless theres some dumb shit in the code somehow preventing u from doing so. 

u can even have them nested in settings. im gonna keep looking but i saw an article on keeping desktop mode from tab to tab/permanently (also annoying, no middleground because SOME sites i do like mobile view on and am not gonna need zoom but LOTS of sites i dont like mobile view on and/or also like/almost need double tap) and that sites solution is shit/ridiculous.

obviously i have no idea how yall program stuff but that should just be an obvious example. dviewsitevar could be an array that holds the boolean value for desktop mode for any given site in a file.

u could have a client-side file storing any given website name (reduced to the first part i.e. reddit.com or etc.gov or whatever)), followed by the ""number""/order it was stored (to be read for websitenumber)/added to settings as always being desktop

The guy seemed really nice so I took a massive gamble and gave him my username and password. He phoned me and we logged him in live on the phone.

1837,h0pb25,Maybe the Pixel 3a or the Xperia 5? Both are taller and wider than the S9 but they're some of the narrowest new Android phones. I'm not recommending the Pixel 4 because of its horrible battery life. The 4a should have been launched but no one knows when it'll show up. Alternatively you could consider the iPhone 11 Pro if you don't mind moving over to iOS.,,1

1840,h0pb25,Thanks! I live jn Brazil so it's hard to find a Pixel but it's nice to know the s20 is almost the same size. How do you feel about the battery?,,1
1841,h0pb25,"The display is a downgrade as far as the quality is concerned but I'm assuming they'll make the trade-off for better battery life which is something they mention they want. The software experience is subjective, some people prefer Google's UI, others prefer One UI. The faster storage is the only downgrade that's likely to be noticeable imo.

Unfortunately OEM's just don't seem interested in making smaller phones anymore. I suppose there's the iPhone SE 2020 but I'm not sure if it's battery life is going to match the S9's.",,1

1843,h0pb25,"The s20 is almost the same size as the S9. The iPhone X/XS/11 Pro are little shorter than S9, little wider, and the 11 Pro is definitely a better phone (maybe even the Xs) - I'm ignoring the iOS vs android debate here though.

Edit: fixing forgetting the ""Pro"" in iPhone 11 Pro",,2
1844,h0pb25,The S20 is a good size but the battery life could be good or mediocre depending on your region. The 11 Pro is a similar size but the 11 is quite a bit bigger.,,1

It is unlikely that a provider would reserve a limited resource while offline so it is likely to change, unless you've subscribed to reserving it. A VPN or Proxy connects a provider to another provider.

2051,h03jlx,"As someone who has done this, MANY times, a few thoughts.

First, you are currently an apple person, so you are not used to the android controls. Find a friend, or better yet a few friends, who have been android users for a while, at least a couple of years. See if one of them has a phone they upgraded from they do not want, Free is always the best, especially when you are just trying this, first attempt.  Make sure they do not mind if you ask them questions.

Wipe the data on that phone, it is not hard at all to do, just google factory data reset (model of phone), always do a full reset on a phone you just acquired, it is the safest way to go.

while you are googling, read how to put an SD card in, go buy the biggest one that phone will support and you can justify spending the money for.  I just bought a couple of 128 Gig cards for like 26.00, I think it was from Costco, not sure.

Get your accounts set up, ask questions if you need to. I usually install Pandora, Spotify, Youtube, Simple audio book player, ( I listen to audio books a lot) and whatever music player is highly rated in the play store right now. There are a lot of players, if one annoys you uninstall it and try a different one.

Drag a bunch of music onto it and have fun!

2130,gzpbv9,"It actually *is* an app issue: they need to register an intent (Android term) that tells the operating system they want to handle files of that type. Once the intent is registered, when you try to open the file, Android will check the registered intents and either open it directly (if there's only one app that matches, or you've chosen a default) or prompt you (if there are multiple and you haven't chosen a default). If they haven't registered an intent for those files, Android doesn't know they're able to handle them.

Intents are part of the app's code, so unless you are developing this app, you can't really do anything about it.",,1

*Have you opened the app on your phone since you installed it?* It's possible that it hasn't registered its intents and permissions with the OS yet, if you haven't opened it at least once.

If you long-press on the app icon and choose App Info (circled i) > Advanced > Open by default, is the top section a) enabled and b) not set to ""Don't open in this app""?

Apparently there aren't really any good intent-viewers in the Play Store. But if you found one, the application manifest (where it also registers all the permissions it needs, etc.) should include a section called <intent-filters> that includes a list of MIME types it supports. For example, the application manifest for Amazon Kindle includes intents for `application/pdf`, etc. so you can open PDF files with Kindle even though they're not Kindle files.",,1

Also, I suppose that it would just slow down your phone if you receive a lot of notifications at the same time because the phone runs out of ram. I think it depends on how the Rom regulates input that goes over the devices performance, it could either heavily slow down the device until it can catch up and execute all the commands (all the notifications), since that would also heat the phone it could probably cause it to crash.

I'd say it depends on the phone model and os regulations. Appregulation also should play a role since some apps probably only output a limited number of notifications in a specified time no matter how man message the app should output.

Edit 2, Credit to u/catdude142: Android's are usually a better value and competition between OEMs drives down prices making them generally cheaper.

 Also expandable SD card storage is another big plus about Android. Get more local storage by just inserting an SD card that way if you ever run it off space, you don't have to buy a new phone with more storage, instead just expand the storage of your old one

Edit 3: OLED screens with better OLED support. Android's Always On Display functionality is something yet to see on iOS devices. If the feature is turned on it will show the time, date and notification icons when the device is turned off. It is able to turn of the rest of the unused screen pixels other than the ones it is using to display therefore using very minimal battery

Edit 4, Credit to u/ShuvamTheBeast: Android has some really cool apps that you can't get anywhere else like Tasker, an app that lets you schedule take and do IFTT (if this then that) stuff.

Edit 5: Wireless Charging has seems to be much better on Android phones, they've had it for longer and had more time to innovate on it and perfect it. Samsung's wireless chargers and wireless charging systems seem to be ones currently at the top of the game, with blazing fast wireless charging speeds

Edit 6: Google Pay seems to work better. And if you have a Samsung phone, you have access to Samsung pay which uses a cool trick and therefore can be accepted anywhere you can swipe your card. Google has also allows apps to use the NFC system with the users permission, therefore, Android has gone a lot farther with NFC even allowing to share files just by tapping two phones through NFC",,23

So, the vendors that make hardware interactive accessories, do it for Apple first.

An app cannot wake it self from battery restrictions. When an app's server receives notifications for you, the servers tells google, google tells the play services on your phone, and play services wakes up the app, and the app then connects to the server to get the notifications.

2216,gzohgt,"I don't know of Android version but recuva for be windows does exactly this. I reckon you could use recuva to scan the phone.

How widows and MacOS works is it doesn't actually delete your data. It deleted the reference to it.

Imagine your hard drive as a warehouse. At the front door of the warehouse is a manager. People come into the warehouse with photos, apps, updates etc (think yif these as boxes, for later). The manager looks in his book, says put it in section x, shelf y, spot z. This is how computers find where information is on a hard drive.

Now deleting. All that happens is someone walks into the warehouse and says to the manager ""I want to delete x"". So he gets out his book and scores it out. Nobody actually gets the box and throws it out. That's all. The reference to the information is deleted but not the information. It's actually still on the disk.

Obvious question you might ask is ""what happens if someone comes into the warehouse and is told to put their box in one of these spots that's had a box but it's still there."" The box is simply replaced by the new box. 

This is why people say to zero disks or even physically destroy then. Simply reinstalling the OS leaves HUGE chunks of information sitting on the disk. Programmes like recuva simply scan the disk for unreferenced data and shows you what it is. Unfortunately as it's unreferenced, it can't know where it was in your file system, what it's for our anything. It'll just have a huge list of files. Some of which will be incomplete data (a 0.5mb file taking up some space of a 2mb file leave just 1.5mb left of it.",,1
2217,gzohgt,"This is a good explanation. And a few others in this thread have said something similar. 

However, and not to sound like a dick... but you're all kind of referencing old info or things that don't generally apply to phones. 

Everyone that keeps talking about how ""data is not actually deleted, only the reference to it"" is accurate. However, with modern use of SSDs and how TRIM works, what you guys are saying doesn't apply 95% of the time. TRIM does in fact delete the file unlike what happens on drives that don't have TRIM enabled. 

This also doesn't take into account that all modern phones use encryption as well",,1
2218,gzohgt,"Well I'm assuming the encrypion won't apply once the phone is legitimately accessed by the user. Unless OP doesn't actually have access to the phone. Once access is granted by Android that won't matter.

Also looks like recuva do have an Android too but I can confirm it works from windows to windows to Android with the windows tool. How long TRIM takes to work I don't know, but it worked just now. I didn't wait that long though to be fair.",,1

2435,gyrd8c,"Well tbh at this point all flagship phones camera quality is very close.

To access a picture you can check several things like 

How bright is the brightest part of image?

How dark are the dark parts of image?

Does the image have realistic colors? Some phones saturate image. 

In case of selfie, how is the skin? Does it look natural? Is the color of skin right? Is it too smoothed out?

Also try zooming in images and notice distant objects.",,1
2436,gyrd8c,"As for the megapixels ... Basically if you increase your megapixels you can get more detail but it comes with a price. 

Higher the megapixels ... More storage it will take because there's more information. This is why most phones do something called binnig. Basically a full 64mp photo is too big for your phone so they take 4 pixels as one pixel and make it a 16 mp photo.

Higher megapixels also means worse low-light performance.

Higher megapixels also means a bigger camera sensor causing bigger camera bumps and Samsung was facing alot of focus issues w their 108mp main camera because of how big the sensor was.

The best config I've seen is samsung s20. 12MP main and Ultra wide for perfect ratio of detail to low light performance. 64 MP telephoto because that's where detail counts and it allows for better digital zoom.

Check this [video](https://youtu.be/vFSi3AA5ulU) for more detailed explanation of why 12 mp.",,0

In reviews even if the camera is 99% there they tend to talk about the 1% that's left and well that's their job. But these cameras are solid and you're not missing out on much.,,2

I turned on the Bluetooth button on my headphones just in case it could trick them into thinking they aren't connected by a cable, therefore making it so I would have to press the volume buttons on my headphones instead of the volume buttons on my phone (at least the option to). So far it is working, I'm moving my cable in all ways and nothing is happening, so I might've solved it, tyvm. Hopefully it is a permanent solution",,1
2526,gymhkk,"my quick reaction would no, the s7 has a 1440p  AMOLED   screen vs IPS 1080p , but the Honor does have USB C and a better camera and bigger battery , and Android 9 not sure what the s7 has now it came with 6",,2
2527,gymhkk,what size memory /storage on each phone?,,1
2528,gymhkk,"Yes the screen is nice but it is 5.1inch and the 9x around 6.6inch at 84% coverage. Having usb-c is probably more an issue currently. I have 0 cable for usb-c. Does it support hdmi over usb-c? I think it doesn't as its an older version of usb-c.

Samsung dropped hdmi out support with the s7 and I would like to have that again. But it is not a deciding factor.

My battery is currently 70% of its orginal. or 2000mah estimated capacity with 3000mah design capacity. The 9x has 4000mah, but a large battery isn't always better, battery optimization play a large role.

I think s7 is currently Android 8.0.

Also I said swap in the title, but it's likely I'll be able to sell my phone for 100-200, on the lower end and the 9x costs 150.  


Edit: the 9x is USB-C 2.0 (OTG) and I don't really know what that means. Also I've heard USB-C connectors are weaker than Mirco-USB so I don't know if I'm looking forward to the future of USB-C.",,2
2529,gymhkk,"Samsung s7 32GB storage and 4GB memory. 

9x 128GB storage and 4GB memory.",,1
2530,gymhkk,"70 percent is pretty bad, I feel obliged to mentioned that when I sold it, maybe the bigger screen and its much newer   battery   tips the balance in the honours favour , here you you could get around 100 pounds for a s7 no way 200",,1
2531,gymhkk,"I have crap eyes I wouldnt like to use a 5 inch screen for long , the honor 9x is worth more on ebay here than the s7",,1
2532,gymhkk,"USB-C cables and connectors are much stronger than micro-USB.

As the tips ofUSB-C cables are less-flimsy, it does not get damaged easily.

USB-C is also easier to insert into the port, which means the USB-C port is less-likely to get damaged like a micro-usb port, where the csble-tip will have to be inserted in a more precise click, where people unintentionally tend to press too hard.",,1
2533,gymhkk,"if you do lots of micro managing because of the 32gb , get the 9x , I wouldnt be happy losing the AMOLED 1440p though",,1
2534,gymhkk,"all you're really gaining is some space , which you could off-set with a sdcard , and swamping is a risk if you dont know the person , im not sure I would bother, if the s7 is working OK",,1
2535,gymhkk,"Yeah luckily I don't use it much and always have a battery pack available if I'm caught out. AccuBattery say's at 100% it is about 4 hours with screen on and 45 hours with screen off. It feels like a larger difference than it actually is.  


Yeah hopefully I can find a 9x in store to compare to the two.",,1
2536,gymhkk,Yeah I think I might be lucky to sell it for the same price as an 9x. I wonder what will be easier to sell / worth more in a year though?,,1
2537,gymhkk,"I am very lucky, I have my laptop connected to a 55inch 2160p screen. Viewing at less than 2 meters on the couch. Struggling to find a use case for my phone tbh, but might be nicer to have something new.",,1
2538,gymhkk,"Same here, though I am using a lifeproof case which someone distorts the screen, but it has saved the phone atleast a dozen times.

I'm not sure I can get a case of equal quality for the 9x and I am not sure how I feel about spending 50%-100% of the price of the phone on a case. Are 9x parts affordable and accessible? I would rather self-repair a screen for 30 than spend 80 on a case.

I have a 32GB MicroSD card, other than that being close to full no issues with the 32GB on the phone. I could clear that for more space, but need to invest in more backup storage first.",,1
2539,gymhkk,"Sorry I didn't make it clear in the title, I would sell my phone and then buy the 9x, probably having to put in $$ and selling the phone would be a hassle. S7 is working great, really should get a larger sd card though. I like the large screen on the 9x, pop up camera (no notch) and 3.5mm jack and 128GB base storage. The camera is an upgrade and I'm not using my phone for multimedia consumption much, it's probably most useful to me as a camera to me so it could be an upgrade there? Though I barely use it for that - and it seems the 9x doesn't have video stabilization, shoots in 1080p and mine shoots in 2160p and not sure about stabilization.",,2
2540,gymhkk,I handled a s7 recently nice phone be hard to beat build quality wise,,1
2541,gymhkk,The market is smart people will pay what's it's  worth I wouldn't worry about that,,1
2542,gymhkk,Yes technically getting the newer phone is reducing risk,,1
2543,gymhkk," I dont think the case and parts will be an issue  , the honor 9x was a popular phone",,1
2544,gymhkk,I don't think hassle is worth it for a side ways move maybe sell spend a bit  and get a  s8,,1
2545,gymhkk,"Yeah it's been great, unbreakable in a lifeproof case. I upgraded from the s5. Still missing the infrared port and recently wanted to use hdmi out, but samsung dropped support for it in the s6 and s7, not sure if they've brought it back.",,2
2546,gymhkk,"Yeah and 2 years warranty, but should be useless on a new phone unless you get accident insurance as well.",,1
2547,gymhkk,"It's a shame it doesn't have the 810, it is a like 40% more performance than the 710f, but maybe that is already reflected in the price - which is more of a concern.",,1
2548,gymhkk,"s8 looks good, but it looks like it's twice the price or $300 new.   


My key requirements are not to spend any money, or at least very little. For the phone to have no notch and a 3.5mm jack. I found the 9x because it was the lowest priced phone to meet this criteria, when also selecting for 128GB+ storage.  


I think I would prefer to have a pop up camera, but I am not sure that matters, probably between 60-70% sure on this. Would be nice to know someone can't access it though.",,1
2549,gymhkk,Nah infra red is long gone :),,1
2550,gymhkk,"I've blagged a few repairs after breaking something , but yeah insurance needed",,1
2551,gymhkk,I don't the CPU difference matters much with light use,,1
2552,gymhkk,"I have background in Engineering and I would avoid pop-up cameras is just another thing that can break, probably a pain to fix as well",,1
2553,gymhkk,"yes im having to dodge the s20 , no headphone jack, I refuse to buy a phone without one",,1
2554,gymhkk,I think the 9x has it.,,1
2555,gymhkk,"Now I think of it I did need to get the s7 repaired under warranty once as the charge port fried, either due to residual water or a broken charger / combination of both.   


It would probably be worthwhile to have a device under warranty again.",,1
2556,gymhkk,"The only reason I spend a large amount for the s7 was because I couldn't stand the frustration of slow loading devices, that was the norm on cheap devices a few years ago - not so much now.  


I imagine the CPU should hold up for the next few years, but could be wrong, and I can't stand slow or incapable devices.",,1
2557,gymhkk,I don't watch TV so see no use for it,,1
2558,gymhkk,Ha my S10 just fried for the same reason,,1
2559,gymhkk,"problem is theres more to a phone than the cpu, what about the ram and the flash ?storage , perhaps a top their phone like the s7 is better than a newer mid-range phone in those areas , its normally the battery charge loss that slows down phones alway, takes a long time for top tier phone cpu to be too slow for standard apps Imho",,1
2560,gymhkk,Same though I probably find myself in a few waiting areas where I wouldn't mind turning a TV off.,,2
2561,gymhkk,"Hopefully they cover it!  


I'd taken my phone windsurfing - being alone and new to the sport I carried my phone for emergency. The lifeproof case isn't that great and water got it. The phone survived that but later on that day when it went flat I tried charging it with a friends charger, and the normal pop up didn't display, I left it plugged in hoping it would charge, but in the end something was wrong and it never turned back on.   


It probably didn't charge because it detected water, or my friends charger sucked, I am not sure now if the charger was working with other phones.",,2

2673,gyf0i9,"Unfortunately companies advertise the total amount of raw flash storage (the ’size' of the chips themselves), but you have to count file system overhead (e.g. you have to store what file is where in the chips, in a kind of lookup table / table of contents, among others), usually after this you have 13-14 GBs left.

On top of this,  the system itself takes up space from the 16GB as well. So this leaves you with 9-10GB actually usable.

The most likely reason phone manufacturers don't let you put Apps on SD cards, is because they're extremely slow compared to the internal storage, so when you want to load an app from it, loading times are multiples of what it would otherwise be, and most likely to the average user that marks the whole phone as 'slow'.

Nowadays I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy a phone with less than 32GBs of storage (which usually have about 25GBs usable), And I would go for 64 or more for myself, but that's for my personal use.",,2

Unfortunately, nowadays a 16gb device is just barely enough to run modern Android, and I know of two manufacturers (HMD Nokia and Motorola) who have offered ""16GB"" Android Go devices that don't actually have 16gb..
Example.
The Nokia One Plus has only 14.9GB whilst the Moto E5 play has 14.3 GB...... neither device has the amount of storage advertised.

The absolute minimum anyone should consider now is 32gb because it gives you well over 20gb of usable storage, and doesn't cost much more that the same 16gb version of the same device.",,1

*Android Go is NOT designed for high end flagship devices like a galaxy note 8.*

You need a ""regular"" Android version.

First, if you have a US carrier locked device, you can forget updating to android 10, as US carrier locked Samsung's CANNOT be bootloader unlocked so you can't flash any ROMs.
There's currently NO workaround or fix.

Secondly, if you don't have a US carrier locked device, goto XDA and search the note 8 threads for Android 10 custom ROMs

2810,gy4ajh,Check out if buds support aptx before purchasing a new one,,2
2811,gy4ajh,"There are some things to look out for. Other comments aren't entirely well-informed.

Any wireless earbuds with a modern codec like AptX (HD) or AAC will not have latency when doing non-realtime stuff like watching a youtube video. This is because although there is a delay, the delay is communicated back to your phone and the video is synced up by delaying it the same amount. Works like a charm.

However, if you want to play games or make music or whatever with wireless headphones, you will get a delay. The only codec at this time that addresses this is AptX Low Latency. But on the wireless headphones I've tried the latency is still noticeable, though a lot less. So although ""good"" options exist I would really recommend you try them out with a real-time task before purchasing. If the latency is a lot less but still enough to be annoying you might still prefer a wired option.",,2
2812,gy4ajh,"Most of the new models should be without delay, but to be sure just make sure the headphones support aptx, which is the low latency codec that they use in most modern headphones. I think Samsung uses their own version, ssc. Aac is Apple's version. Ldac is also good.

Any headphones made in the last year *should* support one of these low latency codecs",,2

2824,gy489s,"check the system properties to find the hardware model number and firmware revision.  Does it have a Dual-SIM slot?

&#x200B;

It's more than likely a Chinese-market hardware revision, which means it defaults to Chinese language, Chinese carrier firmware, and 3/4 of the radios onboard are useless outside China because they're the wrong frequency for cellular carriers elsewhere.  So if you are using the phone in Europe or North America, you're getting worse coverage and speed than a domestic phone because your phone likely only supports 2 or 3 common radio bands of a half-dozen the carrier may be using.

Almost every phone model has a half-dozen or more different hardware versions for South Korea, China, EMEA and the Americas, usually with a short-bus version specifically for Verizon as well because the radio frequencies and bands are different and the CPU integration and performance is different too.  And each model requires a different OS firmware image, mostly not compatible.

Apps can't see the WiFi networks around you unless you've granted location permission (there are databases that map WiFi networks to location, so you can actually determine someone's location given a list of WiFi networks).

In this case, I think that ""WiFi devices"" refers to the connected devices on the same network (like IoT devices and such). I think this permission is intended so that apps like Philips Hue and Sonos can communicate with their respective devices on your local network.

As for vulnerabilities, I'm not sure there are too many (but bear in mind that I'm not 100% sure as to what this permission gives access to). AFAIK it's a little like letting apps through Windows Firewall--it lets the app communicate on your local network.

Your smartphone's memory, processor, GPU, and other core components are passively cooled. Doing so increases longevity of your device and safety. Your memory card doesn't have such options. Constantly running sequential reads and writes to it will significantly degregate your memory card and future reduce it's usefulness. In short, I'd recommend storage only for memory cards in addition to a cloud storage option with(if possible), local backups on a trusted computer at home. Google Photos is a convenient option for cloud storage and with Android, already installed on your phone. Open Google Photos (the pinwheel looking icon), head to the options with the three lines at the top left, settings, backup and sync. If you have unlimited data, then enable backup over Data for both pictures and videos.

https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/install-location

It's just too many, that a lot of apps shouldn't allow it unless they have some special fallbacks. For most developers it's not worth the extra work, because it also means to keep supporting yet another aspect of the app, for each new and existing feature they have.

Also, as written there, an app is allowed to be installed on the SD-card only if the developers marked it as such, which means they are ok with that as they've (probably) tested it themselves, that nothing goes wrong when you do it.

As a side note, moving to SD-card makes the app usually load everything slower, as SD-cards are usually slower than internal storage. Not sure how much slower though.",,2

2921,gxw6zf,"It's because external memories form have the same speed, that's the most important.

r/android is not a subreddit for asking questions like yours, it's not a help and support subreddit or one to go to to ask custom ROM questions.

You can't remove preinstalled gapps without editing the ROM zip, and I'm unsure that's even possible or if it is, it's complicated.
Something I've never done so I can't say.

Usually as a rule developers use smaller gapps packages to keep the zip files smaller.
It's not being harsh or forcing anything on you the user.
The developer decides what's best for the rom, please respect that.

You do have a choice though.
if the ROM you want to use doesn't have the preinstalled gapps you want, you simply flash the ROM with no gapps and then flash the gapps you want seperately.

So you can't delete pre installed Gapps? That's a bit harsh then because it's the official version of the ROM I'd like to download and it's like forcing it down the throat anyways, thanks again.",,1

Their r certain devs that implement AROMA installer like TheGalaxyProject Rom it enables you to choose and install different apps and features during the ROM installation with one of those options being asking whether you'd like to install Micro, nano or pico GAPPS along with a lot of other options like what kernel or custom kernel and baseband version to install.",,2

The way the circuitry works in a phone causes it to consume a *very* small amount of power (even when ""off"") to sense the power button.  That takes a small amount of current.  

The ""power switch"" on a phone is a momentary contact switch that triggers the power up sequence when depressed.  The power switch is not an ""open/close"" (SPST) type of switch like a wall switch or similar which would stop all power consumption.  It's a bit different.

The only way to cease all power consumption by the phone would be to remove the battery but for all practical purposes, the amount of power used to sense the switch is so small it would take a long time before one noticed any power consumption from an ""off"" phone.

3206,gwxmao,Yeah well that rly sucks! Lol I figured it had something to do with that I'll just change my lock screen picture no biggie.. I just rly dig it and didn't wanna change it.. Thanks for all the help tho I def appreciate it man! But what is this custom ROM shit are you talking about? I'm not familiar with any tech stuff I always ask my buddy. Lol but does this ROM thing change it from Oreo to maybe something newer? Like lollipop or marshmallow? Or is there anyway to root my phone? Again thanks for the help!,,1
3207,gwxmao,"Custom ROMs are aftermarket firmwares for supported phones and Samsungs are very well supported - if your device can been bootloader unlocked.
So in effect, you can flash any android version from Oreo (what you have now) to pie (android 9) or android 10 (the current latest android version)
Lollipop (android 5.1) and marshmallow (android 6) are much older versions that you can't flash to your device - you cannot flash an older version than you already have - downgrading is possible but technically challenging and complicated. Forget that.

Some US carriers make their devices unlockable, you buy the phone direct from the carrier much cheaper but give up any further future customisation because they lock down the device bootloader.
There's no workaround or hacks for these devices.

If you can't unlock the bootloader, it's impossible to root or flash custom ROMs unfortunately.",,1

As for HouseParty, it may have registered a receiver that keeps it running.

3216,gwu0bl,"As far as I know, yes the devs of the apps should be coding the box as password boxes so that the keyboards detect it as such. One way to check if it's an issue with the devs of the app or a bug on the keyboard, try another keyboard and see if it still remembers. 

One way that's easy and you don't have to type anything is Swiftkey. Just slap a bright colored theme on Swiftkey, then tap the password box. If the theme stays, then it's not coded as a password box. If the theme disappears and you are shown a sort of ""incognito"" dark gray theme with the top options bar missing, it's detected as a password box. 

Another way is to simply use password managers like Bitwarden.",,2

3230,gwpuvz,"First thing you should know is generally speaking, cleaner apps, antivirus, ram boosters/managers/etc and the like are garbage you want to stay well away from. They screw up your device and mess with the way your device normally handles itself, and they generally require far too many permissions that are a bit invasive. Many of these types of apps - notably, anything by cheetah mobile, which iirc was finally kicked out of the play store - are not built for your benefit, but to make the dev money through pushy ads or outright stealing your info.

That said, files by google (formerly files go) is a really good app. There is a cleaner function that's built in, but it doesn't mess with your device the way most other apps do, and gives you more control over what it ""cleans"". There's also an airdrop-like sharing feature built in, which is really nice, if a bit slow at times. You can use this app to clear up some of your storage space.

Second thing you should consider is that you didn't actually uninstall the apps, or they're maliciously hiding themselves. You should never install from any source besides the official play store, f droid (open source repository with a good reputation), or apkmirror (run by the Android police folks and they're professionals with standards). Go to your device settings, then apps, then select show all apps, hunt through there and uninstall anything you downloaded but thought you got rid of. There will be plenty of things you can't uninstall that are part of the OS, and depending on your device, ROM, etc, a bunch of apps you don't need/want, but still can't get rid of anyway (that's why I only buy pixel devices: they're stock Android without bloatware).

Also, as an aside, you should be using google photos and disabling your other gallery app, if you have one. That'll allow you to back up your photos to your google account, and in the app you won't notice the difference between ones on your device vs only in the cloud. You can gain some storage there too by deleting photos from your device. (But ONLY your device! Careful not to delete the cloud copy!)

https://youtu.be/tUX-frlNBJY",,2
3235,gwpuvz,"if you want a very clean storage and better UX I would recommend you look into rooting and custom roms. There are apps like SD Maid Pro which I absolutely love. I have cleaned more than 15GB of junk files with that app, absolutely love it. With the Pro version I bought I can schedule it to clean itsself once a week while I'm sleeping. (If you are willing to root and buy this app, the Pro version is much better). For a better user experience and fluidity I use Adaway, just blocks adds. Although I do keep ads on for free apps since devs need to eat too. For battery saving apps I use NapTime, Servicely and FrancoKernelManager, all are amazing and all require root access. As for your question, what I would regularly do when I wasn't rooted was do a factory reset every 6 months. This gave me peace of mind that all my files were clean and all supposed viruses were removed. As for apps which don't require root acess and clean files, I have never had one work for me. Tbh they all seem like a fancy animation to me and that's it. If you actually wanna clean, use the cleaner in your settings, I fnd that the most effective, but yet again, not all phones have that feature built in. I hope my comment helped you and others!

Edit: Forgot to mention there is an option in the Play Store where you can mass delete all apps you want. Google Play Store > threee lines in the top left corner > My apps and games > Installed > Storage and there you can uninstall any apps you want without the annoying pop up you get when manually uninstalling apps. Also, I agree with u/mrandr01d comment a lot. Very great points!",,0

Somehow I always have 1GB+ worth of cache. Everytime I want to ""boost"" my phone speed it shows it disabling apps I'm not even using or have ever opened.

Secondly, I think this was a lesson for my my mistake.
I was too carefree when it comes to downloading apps from the internet. I think both when I'm unistalling or deleting the original file to install from it adds to my internal storage.

I didn't mean to say that built in gallery apps are bad because they're malicious or anything, it's just that I think they're clutter. In the pre-GPhotos days, that was just how you managed your pictures, and you were left SOL for a backup solution you didn't piece together (and maybe even pay for) yourself. Now GPhotos is very capable of managing all that, so you can have your cake and eat it too, all in one app. No point (especially for someone's who's not as interested in tech) in dealing with a second, less capable app that might even incidentally screw up your photo roll, imo.",,1

It seems to me you may have just spoken out of no experience whatsoever. Yes I understand OP isn t that tech savy, but no one is at the beginning. Just saying that things are bad without any experience or proof whatsoever is stupid on its own. I expect you to either back up your statement with facts or just then seek attention elsewhere.

Also I understand free non root apps are really bad, and mess with your device but they honestly can t mess it up THAT much. Without root access most exploits are used by third party apps and not by apps from the play store. I despise all battery and storage optimisers besides the ones I mentioned in my comment above. I have more than 4  years of experience with rooting and almost 9 years of experience with android. I have tried a lot of stupid stuff and I have a pretty good general ideea of which apps are bad an which are not so. I also recommend apps from which are open source but a lot of them aren't so there s not much you can do about that. If you bring me solid proof of those solid apps ""fucking up"" your device or being malicious I will apologise, but I honestly don't think that's the case right now.",,0
