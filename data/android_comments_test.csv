Samsung, who was the opposite of Apple back in the days, is now the same as Apple, just with Android os. Huawei is even worse.

Locked bootloaders became the norm. But also officially unlockable bootloaders became the norm for some brands. When buying a phone make sure it's unlockable. Google has moved a lot of stuff from aosp to their proprietary services. Banking (and some other areas) are hard to do on an unlocked phone. Contrary to what other users say: people still root their phones and mod the hell out of it, just google Magisk. But I'd say back in the day customizing android was almost necessary, while today it's more of a hobby for many people.

There is a new type of universal roms, calles gsi roms. Those can be installed on any (newish) android phone with unlockable bootloader, no device specific rom needed any more. Those are quite new and standard roms are still mostly used though.",,6

>Headphone jacks and SD cards are disappearing too

Partially due to the rising expectation and demand for IP67+ specs on phones, (having said spec on a phone with open ports is a serious engineering challenge indeed ). Combined with the fact that consumers indicated that they are willing to let the jack go, theres been little resistance on the jack going away on the consumer side. The SD cards disappearing is down to many Smartphone manufacturers planning on trying to get folks to buy cloud storage instead (also, again apple showed consumers will tolerate this lack of upgrade-ability and will buy icloud storage).

- Bloatware is far less of an issue (not entirely but better)

- Smoothness is no longer a massive issues, even for budget phones - so no need to tweak kernels or anything like that to get it to not stutter.

- Rooting can disable improtant features like contactless payment.

192,hel1ga,"It's not dead. Tons of people still root, check out r/AndroidRoot to get a better picture.

It's just not as widespread and popular as it used to be back in the ""golden era"", mainly its because:

a) Android and the hardware it runs on is now ""good enough"" for most people - no need to OC or change skins or debloat (on a decent device). There are stock Android devices like the Google Pixel, OnePlus or Android One devices, which work really well out of the box and there's little reason to warrant messing with them. Even Samsung devices have come along a long way with their new OneUI skin that replaced the old laggy and bloated TouchWiz skin, and it looks pretty decent too.

b) it's becoming increasingly a PITA to keep up with all the changes Google is doing (eg the A/B partition system) the security measures they keep implementing (SafteyNet). Rooting may be viable now but not tomorrow. Not everyone has the enthusiasm or patience to keep up with all this.

c) on many devices, rooting comes with disadvantages like not being able to view Netflix in full HD or playing the cat-and-mouse game with banking apps, games and some social media apps that detect root. On Samsung devices, merely unlocking the bootloader permanently blows the eFuse which permanently voids warranty and also permanently removes certain features like Secure Folder and Private Browsing, which reduces the resale value of the device.

d) OTAs can also be a pain depending on the device you're using. On some devices, OTAs may not work at all. On some devices, you may need to unroot before you accept an OTA. On all devices, you'll need to manually restore root after an OTA.

So as a result, we don't generally recommend anyone to root, unless they have a *really* good use case and are prepared to accept all the headaches that come with it.

Personally, as a geek and security/privacy conscious person, I always root and ROM all my Android devices and will continue doing so for the foreseeable future.",,3

With the backside manufacturers are actually getting increasingly creative, with crazy materials reflecting light in multiple colors etc. The backsides used to be a lot more boring back in the days!

Imo a modernized m7 would be the ultimate design: Make it almost bezelless on the sides, but leave a small bezel on the top and bottom. Integrate those kick ass stereo speakers there, plus front camera, sensor etc. pp. We can spare those 2mm.

You should have a setting in display to turn three button navigation back on (Nokia's, Samsung and most other android 10 devices do)

The S9 is running OneUi from Samsung and it's quite bloated with all the Samsung extra apps. You can root it and do some changes on it but there's pros and cons to that.

The 6T is very similar to the OP7. Almost identical to the naked eye (I have the OnePlus 7). It has better specs and performance than the S9. It is a faster phone and it will, in my opinion, last you longer. OnePlus phones tend to age well. If you are going for very close to stock feeling, this phone does that and it does it very smooth as well. Almost 0 bloat too. It is very customizable even without rooting it.

However, if camera is a big point for you, I suggest you have a look at some reviews for both phones on that aspect. S9 will probably be a better camera phone. There is GCam for OnePlus, but it's not perfect and it requires some manual customization.

If you don't care much for the camera, go for 6T. If camera is very important to you, do some research of the 2 based on camera.",,2

It seems like when the phone is \*attempting\* to connect to mobile data it locks the APN settings so you can't play with them. If they're not correct for some reason then it doesn't connect and isn't bright enough to stop trying or give a useful error message. Most people that have fixed it have done so basically by chance after multiple reboots, usually connecting to WiFi straight away helps. 

Makes me wonder if turning airplane mode on would help, maybe a reboot while it's on if the phone remembers that airplane mode is on after a reboot.  
It was also a big issue with the Asus Zenphone, the final fix for that particular phone was a firmware/rom update from Asus.",,2

1. SOS message. If you have a Samsung watch you don't even need to speak or hold your phone for this as well. You can set it up to activate with a triple press of the watch button.
2. Using Google Routines. You set up a custom voice command, so it doesn't need to be ""I'm getting pulled over"", it could be something more discreet, then you set up what you want it to do when it hears you say it. This is the closest thing to the I'm getting pulled over feature on Siri.
3. Bixby Routines option. Say you're language or accent isn't very well understood by Assistant, you can use this.

Here is one using Tasker with Background Recording App:

656,hcvewg,"What sort of phone is it and which version of Android and what's its security patch level? 

There have been some cases of some budget random-brand phones being infected with malware that can survive a factory reset. These phones were running quite an old version of Android that were vulnerable to such malware.

If you're on a recent patch level of Android (any version released this year), then it's unlikely you'll have a persistent malware, therefore a normal factory reset will do the trick and would be the best option. 

I wouldn't recommend relying on third-party ""antivirus"" apps, as they give you a false sense of security. There's no harm in using them for scanning, but as others have said, you'll be better served following best practices such as not installing dodgy, low-reputation apps, avoiding sketchy apk download sites and using a decent adblocker such as AdGuard along with a browser-based Adblock (such as Kiwi Browser + uBlock Origin).

So do the factory reset, make sure your device is up-to-date (this is crucial) and watch what you install. Also, when restoring your data, do not restore any dodgy or suspicious apps - there is no guarantee that all apps on the Play Store are 100% clean, so again, quite important that you stick to well known apps (also, don't rely on ratings and reviews as these can be manipulated - so pay careful attention to the permissions the app requests).",,1

[The efficiency of exynos can vary per phone (example)](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s8/how-to/exynos-chip-binning-t3596434), some chips are only able to operate on a less efficient Adaptive Supply Voltage group and version. The efficiency of cellular can vary other than ASV. This means subjective experiences might vary. Exynos being inferior to Snapdragon refers specifically to the S20, it can also vary for Snapdragon (e.g. Snapdragon 810).

Heat is generated when calculations are performed. If lots of calculations for the chip are performed (compiling, rendering, transcoding, gaming ); any chip will heat.

The calculating chip may slow down to increase its efficiency. On Samsungs this is mostly the Game Optimizing Service. It can be configured e.g. with Game Launcher.

Anyway, on Samsungs, when you have this active, the side gestures of the Android 10 gestures are deactivated and get replaced with this (but the swipe up for home and recents and Assitant are retained). One of the options in this app is quick tools, so you could set a gesture to get a floating window populated by stuff you set, one of which is a volume slider.

If you didn't back up those ""important"" files then you really got no need or right to complain.

You've just got to go into your device settings once a week or once a month or how ever frequently you feel is necessary, and hit the back up button.

1109,hbdz54,"How this worked for me, on Android 9 and still works on 10 now after the update:

In ""my files"" search for the file you want to copy, let's say from the SD card to the internal storage. Mark the file and tap on ""copy"" then click on the folder on the internal storage it should go to and it won't work (greyed out) but if you instead click first on ""internal storage"" then on the folder that pops up then it will work.

Other way around is the same, copy the file, tap on ""sd storage"" even if you can already see the folder it will got to beneath it, do not tap the folder, tap the storage first until on the right side you see all folders on that storage, then tap the folder and now it shouldn't be greyed out anymore.

Though it is possible that it would reconnect as the tower instructs the phone to connect in 4G when there is data in the network to sink into the phone.

Also the fingerprint / face unlock being disabled is to stop the police and other people from going through your phone.",,3

Also for the blue filter, just wait, it's booting up",,3
1276,hav0fg,"There's a couple reasons for this. 

1. A cold boot is doing a lot, so anything optional that can be pushed off it to make it faster is a win. Blue light filter would definitely be something not immediately vital to startup.
2. Security. Anybody can boot a phone. Only the owner should be able to unlock it. Fingerprint readers are hilariously insecure, so the phone forces a pin or password because its higher security. Always On Display could also show personal info, so its best to make sure the right user has unlocked the phone before displaying. 
3. Permissions. Apps have permissions too, so only certain ones can be run during startup. If the developer didn't put in a System App permission or something like that, it likely can't be run until the device unlocks.

There's probably more reasons too, but those are the big ones off the top of my head.

That is insane - you never use MTK tools on a Qualcomm chip device.

Havoc 3.5 is not available for your device yet and neither is lineage OS 17.1 probably because it's difficult to get android 10 working on your device.

You are unfortunately going to have to wait until those ROMs become available, or accept the fact android 10 ROMs may not ever come.

I also suggest you don't do anything if you don't understand the terminology or instructions.
It's really not worth messing up your device and I really don't want to see anyone have that happen to them.",,1
1304,hatx0p,"If the roms you want are not yet available I don't think your device will get them.

XDA is the only place to go for afterlife development and if there is no one in the community interested in getting android 10 ROMs onto your device, they are not going to happen.
I'm not sure android 10 is that easy for your device, if it was, then it would have already happened.

So right now your either got to use older custom ROMs, wait for a developer to work on a new android 10 ROM or forget the whole thing and move on.

Just a word of advice.

If you don't understand anything you read on XDA, forget flashing any ROMs or doing anything to your device.

Too many people go rushing into flashing ROMs or unlocking bootloaders without understanding or even reading the instructions provided and end up posting here crying the following day begging people to help them fix their bricked device.

I'm not being mean, but I don't want you to become another statistic.
If you yourself are now admitting you don't understand what you are reading I strongly urge you not to do anything and forget the whole thing, only because I don't want to see you mess up your device because you don't understand what to do.
If you don't understand anything, there's a huge risk of you messing everything up and leaving your device completely knackered and unusable, which I don't want to see or encourage.

1) Relax, there's no point getting stressed about mails. Everything and everyone can wait 20 min. Otherwise they would phone you instead of mailing you.

2) Disable any battery saver that you might have and disable ""battery optimizations"" for your mail app. 

Most phones have push notifications so the waiting period should be less than a minute. Be sure you don't close the mail app (just leave it open in the background).",,0

1350,haqzeq,"Install FairEmail from F-droid.org (to preventing it from depending on google play services, so if the delay be because of google play services, it won't affect this time) 

Also i suggest you to install F-droid app so you be sure that you always have latest version of FairEmail. (also do the steps below to F-droid app so it can run automatically and check new versions or make sure you manually tap on update repes button and then check updates tab to be sure you always have latest version of FairEmail)

Then create an app password in your account and login with it with the app. (i suggest to enable 2 step verification before this step if you didn't it)

Then exclude FairEmail from battery optimizations and allow it to have unrestricted data access.

Also if you have a phone with strict battery saving behavior like huawei make sure to set FairEmail to manual and enable all options for it in 
- battey > app launch
section. (auto start, run in background and etc)

Also exclude it from auto battery optimizations in samsung or smart battery saver in android pie.

+ go to its settings and set the app to check Emails more frequently although it will use more battery.

Also i suggest you to enable  hardned ssl if you have a famous Email service that you are sure that it supports new TLS security protocols. (Microsoft and Google are OK) so your account be more secure.

1487,hagdi8,"Go to your carrier. Tell them your phnoe broke and the sim broke too. They will give you your sim back. ( same number same all just different actual chip ). Then put the sim in your new/old phone. Insert sim in your device and if it s an older phone, factory reset it, if it s new then just insert the sim and set it up. When google asks you to set up your google account, put your email and press ""forgot password"", then you will be prompted with multiple options to retrieve your account. Google automatically backs up your apps contacts messages and settings. So retrieving you Google Account would be your best bet.

Tips to help you prevent this in the future:

\- although I do not recommend this write you pasword on a piece of paper and put it somewhere like behing a magnet on a refrigirator, or behind a frame or something, this way you rememebr to associate the given object with your password.

\- When making a new password, write it down on a piece of paper next to your nightstand and for a week, every time you go to sleep, just set yourself a goal to say your password out loud 30 times. If you do this for a week, you will remember your password.

\- Use google photos for unlimited high quality photo backup. As the sentence suggests it backs up ALL your photos to your google account for free.

\-Make a slightly different password for every site. I am not ging to expect you to remember 20 different password, but create a ""master password"" like. If your name is Emily Baker and you were born in 1999 on the 2nd of january. set a semi-complicated password like Em0201Ba99ker1999. For every site like Facebook, at the end of your password ad a suffix like ""fb"", for Snapchat add ""sc"", for twitter add ""tt"", for reddit add ""rd"". or something to remember the app by, this way you only have to remember your master password and then remember which suffix you chose.

\-never store important data locally, unless you have to identical hard drivees which you copy to each other every few months, then do NOT store data locally. Your phone can break, your hard drive WILL break at some point. Always store photos on goolge photos. For every other files there are stuff like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. You can even do something like create a telegram account and make yourself a server which you can make private and post different kind of files.

Lesson to be learnt: Phones are phones, and phones do break so back up everything, it's ussualy free :)",,4

1599,ha4fxx,"Absolutely nothing to do with specs. It's all about software. Android is built the same for ALL phone regardless of specs. Sometimes manufacturers like Samsung will add on their own stuff but under the hood it's the same whether you're running a Pixel 3XL or some cheap Samsung you got. As long as they run the right version of android, it'll be OK.

I can't see which version of Android it was introduced on but I can see it existed in 2016 at least. I didn't google that hard but I quickly found an article explaining android self managing this. Which was Android Nougat or Android 7.0 (we're on 11 currently). However it could have been years before that. 

The thing is. Android manages stuff in the background. It'll freeze apps so they won't run stuff. But if you go back to it, it starts where you left off. Starting up apps takes more effort than just continuing. It's like picking up a book with a bookmark, you just open the page where you were at instead of trying to figure out and getting to where you were before which takes time and effort. Apps have to go through their startup process, log in, do whatever they do and then you can go but they YOU might need to get back to the point where you were or whatever. All takes you time which is more for the CPU and RAM to do and especially the battery.

There's also going to be some apps that need to perpetually run in the background and killing them just forces them to restart. Like facebook, you might have it set to see where you are, send notification etc. Even closing the app won't stop those and something needs to run. So closing it doesn't do much if anything but make it resart and go to more effort to find where it was.

And again. Whether you have a big flagship or a cheap budget phone. As long as they're on the same operating system or relevent ones. It's pretty pointless. Unless you're running Android v2.4 or something ancient. I still kill my apps from time to time if they're misbehaving.

1) download a **custom ROM** or AOSP (without the Gapps or Google services) for the note 9 

   ***(i have yet to try it myself on my note 9)*** 

2) download **F-droid**, install it (it's a FOSS based app store)

3) download **Aurora store** from F-droid, install it (it goes into google play store , using a spoof account or anonymously) 

Downside of Aurora store is that apps you've download from it, won't allow you the ability to make in-app purchases. 

downside of not having google play services (if i'm not mistaken -- correct me if i'm wrong yeah) is that you can't use GPS , you can't use push mail from gmail.

So where you want to go?
another big tech company like Apple, Microsoft? 

Or some untrustworthy names that can be even more dangerous if they know your sensitive data than google because at least google won't try to help thieves or such with your data!

What you should do is not escaping from google.

Just disable google assistant, deny sensitive google play service permissions like mic and camera and body sensors (if you don't use a fitness tracking app that relies on it.)

Disable all usage stat permissions that you can live without in apps > special access.

If you can, disable google apps and use alternatives.

For ex.  you can check your emails with FairEmail or K-9 or AquaMail instead of official GMail and Microsoft apps.

You can use protonmail, protoncalendar and in the future protondrive instead of their equivalent google services.

You can use bitwarden, standard notes, joplin, evernote and such instead of keep and google password manager.

You can use firefox that they are trying to by far pushing it in the performance aspect and also have great privacy and purpose.

And also disable tracking features that you don't want in your google account settings. (for ex. I need youtube but not others)

But I'm writing this to recommend you to stop using free VPNs. They (the free ones) are usually known to use your phone (or PC or any device they're installed on) to route internet traffic from other people through your phone and your WiFi, consuming you bandwidth. Idk if they also do other not-so-great things, but usually free VPNs should at least be used with caution and the least times possible because of that.

This could be caused by a software bug in the coding of Twitter, your VPN, or in Android itself (especially if you updated your phone recently and a big went unnoticed).

The fast battery drain is a little concerning and what leads me to believe there could be an issue with your battery. But all batteries degrade over time and some fail rapidly and can display behavior like this. However it is not out of the question that quick battery drain can be caused by a software issue too.

I would just continue to use your phone like normal. If you notice your battery doesn't last as long or continues to do this, you may want to try factory resetting. Same if it keeps crashing. If the problem persists, consider taking your phone to an expert and they can replace the battery if you need or pinpoint the issue in software and hopefully fix it. 

I would not be very concerned about your phone being hacked. The only way this really happens is if you downloaded some file from a shady website and then executed it. Being hacked simply from watching a video on Twitter is very very unlikely.

I completely understand and respect people have privacy concerns, but what your post is explaining is completely unfounded and what you said you have read is not true.

1. No one can remotely root your tablet, it's not possible, so calm down, it's not been rooted.
Root needs the bootloader to be unlocked, so you are honestly expecting us all to believe your fear your tablet had been bootloader unlocked *as well* as rooted?
Pull the other one, it's not happened, I can garuntee it.

2. I've not rooted any android device since 2017, and every device I've had since 2017 has had *two* data folders.
Every android device has two data folders.
One in data and one in android / data.
Perfectly normal.
What you read about two data folders only being seen on rooted devices is completely false, total trash and caused you to get triggered over nothing.

I'm especially annoyed because this is now the fifth post you have made regarding this issue, you've posted in places you shouldn't have posted and you've had your post removed three times, and your original post is still live, just no one has bothered to comment, but here you are again, complaining about your fears, which are completely unfounded and totally rediculous.

If you are so concerned about this issue, just factory reset the bloody tablet and start a fresh and be done with it.
It's not difficult.

I also suggest you don't believe everything you read on line and you stop getting so worked up and upset to the point you feel the need to make five identical posts about Samsung's and androids perfectly normal file system, especially with what's going on in the world right now.
Life is far too short to worry about data folders or ghost rooting.
Get over it.

I've reported this post for two reasons.

1. being repetitive - you've already made four other identical posts.

2. This post is Completely unnecessary because the original is still ""live"" just no one has replied to it, probably because everyone thinks it's silly.

I'm sorry to be so blunt but sometimes it's the best way to deal with this.

Then boot into your phone without root, set up your phone, log into every app you have, even banking apps and then root your phone using the official Magisk insatallation guide found on John Wu's Github. After rooting, enable Magisk Hide and everythign and your banking app should not recognise root anymore.

Only flash with twrp if you flash roms or flash new updates constantly.",,1

You basically need a custom kernel for that and probably a custom ROM. The issue here is that, there isn't even a section on XDA for the X Charge, there's no root for it nor bootloader unlock. So it's pretty much stuck in 32bit. You'll need a new phone.  
Also, be wary when buying. There are a bunch of cheaper phones now that still use 32bit OS.",,1
2058,h8ms06,"According to the device specs on any site, the Xcharge has a 64 bit processor.

https://www.devicespecifications.com/en/model/ecf9442e

But from your own screenshots, it's definitely running a 32bit version of Android.

Unfortunately, such devices cannot run 64 bit versions of Android but you have an even bigger problem.
Cricket do not allow any of their devices to be bootloader unlocked, so even if there was a way to flash a 64 bit version of Android via a custom ROM (and there's not) you can't unlock the bootloader on your device to even attempt such.
There's no workaround.

I'm sorry to say you are currently ""out of luck"" with this device, and please don't be afraid to ask such questions, as there's been a flood of posts about 32 bit devices since Pokémon go announced this change.

Arm 32 bit versions are eventually going to be phased out completely anyway, so you could see this as an early opertunity to change devices.

Little bit of advice - As you live in the US, do not buy devices locked to a US network, as they may be cheaper in the short term but you give up any right to customise the device later on as all network locked devices in the US cannot be bootloader unlocked, so custom ROMs and root will be impossible.
There's no hacks or workarounds either.

Also avoid ALL US Snapdragon chipped Samsungs - especially the A10 and A10E (they are both 32 bit) as they cannot be bootloader unlocked either, and European / Chinese Exynos chipped Samsung's WILL NOT WORK in USA.

The best cheap 64 bit devices available these days are the Moto G7 Power, the Moto E6 plus, Nokia 2.3 and 5.3 and the Xiaomi Redmi 8 - all under £150 in uk ($188)

2174,h8akfh,"Lol I can relate to the Ritalin and long paragraphs of typing. I'm prescribed Adderall myself and I've had times where I'm texting a friend shortly after taking my meds and soon enough I'm going on essay-level tangents about something. 

I've been using Android since I got my first smartphone, and I strongly prefer it. I've tried an iPhone and I don't think I could ever switch to it because they lack so many things on Android that I find to be essential. 

That being said, I can honestly understand why a lot of people favor iPhones. I've always been around more tech savvy people in my life, among my friends and family the vast majority of them are fairly competent with technology, even the less inclined people I know are very familiar with the basics and know their way around their phones/computers at a basic level. The thing is, after working electronics retail I realised how far from the norm that is. The vast majority of people don't care about their tech, they just want to call, text, video call, listen to music and go social media, and they don't want to replace the thing unless they absolutely have to because it doesn't interest them, they just wanna buy one that will continue to function for years because they don't WANT a new one and in general they aren't going to be excited for most new features aside from cameras looking better. 

iPhones provide exactly that. They're simple to use and you basically can't fuck them up or make it do something you don't want it to do accidentally. They also tend to last a long time, so while they're more expensive up front they tend to still work fairly well for years. I've seen people still using an iPhone 6s and even once saw someone still using their iPhone 4 and they ran pretty smoothly still. I'm sure they needed a battery replacement at some point but they otherwise still kept up and didn't feel sluggish. 

Reddit in general consists of more nerds, its just the nature of it considering it's a social media platform that's centered around topics instead of the users. especially on this subreddit, you're not gonna find many of the average users who just want a working phone, you're going to see the users who look into these things more in depth, comparing screen refresh rates in Hz and battery capacities in mAh, things that your average user won't know, or even generally won't care about. if you ask an average person what it means to have a screen run in 90Hz they'll look at you like you just asked them to describe nuclear physics. And that's not even a bad thing, necessarily, they're just not nerds, they don't care about these things, they just want their phone to work. You're not going to win these people over by telling them how great the customization is and how you can set different apps as your default because they won't understand why you'd go out of your way to download a different web browser or messaging app than the one that comes with your phone. 

Most of what Android does better are things that average users would never bother with and Apple has done a great job at making, and marketing their devices to users who just generally aren't super into technology. And when an iPhone user does try an Android, since they hear Android is so much cheaper, they go with a budget model of something like a Motorola, or a 4-5 generations old Samsung, and when it turns out to be terrible, they assume that's the Android experience as a whole and not just that they bought a shitty phone because unlike iPhones, Android isn't really standardized in any way. The latest Pixel and latest Galaxy will be very different from one another in tons of ways and if you don't research you won't know what ways that is, and oftentimes this group of people isn't interested enough to research, they want what they know works for them and they want what they know they like 

I guess my point is, you're probably not going to actually convince any of these people of anything unless they're nerds for technology because for them it boils down to: easy to use, good camera, iMessage, and it looks nice. That's it. I gave up on that whole argument years ago when I realized I'm just not the target audience for an iPhone, they're made with the average user in mind first and foremost. And anyone giving you shit for what kind of phone you have is either immature or intensely shallow so they're not worth your time anyways",,4
2175,h8akfh,"Wow, t'is quite the wall of text!

I don't have any long text, just adding my two cents.

There are many shortcomings in ios that would annoy me, like the lack of customizability and not having a file manager for a long time.

But there where some usability/user experience hickups that really surprised me when using a friends iphone.
E.g: No access to the actual settings via the quick settings menu? Really?

or

* Some setting greyed out because energy saving mode is on *

JUST TURN THE F*ING ENERGY SAVING MODE OFF AUTOMATICALLY INSTEAD OF COMPLETELY BLOCKING THE SETTING!!!


And while the ignorance is just as strong where I live, at least the attitude isn't as bad. Luckily. I have no problem with anyone using an iphone, but idiots feeling special for it can sure get me in a rage.

2183,h8akfh,Interesting..,,1
2184,h8akfh,"I see. OP - if you like Android, just get it and don’t worry about what other people think?

There are a ton of articles and forum posts here and everywhere (basically) that outlines the the pros and cons of each platform. Still, if your goal is to prove to your friends that Android is better than iPhone (when they are already committed to iPhone) that might drive a wedge in your friendship. I’m not a big fan of group messages so I don’t get the hype around iMessage. I use an iPhone and when I message someone on Android it sent via SMS — that isn’t a big deal.",,2
2185,h8akfh,">Dam that's long

Yeah, amusingly the Adderall ramblings that I mentioned in the first line happened here lmao got a little carried away but theres just a lot of little things that are all small realisations on the topic that I've had.

 I used to feel apple stuff was just overpriced garbage and that people using it were stupid for paying a premium just to have something that does less than I got for less money, but in reality it's just that their devices are quite good for their intended audience and as far as phones are concerned I've just never been in that category. 

Amusingly I've actually started to come to like some of Apple's products and software a lot once I started using them. As a pet project I converted my PC to a dual-boot Windows/Hackintosh, originally because I felt I'll likely need to learn to use Apple stuff for my career and it would be good to have hands on experience, and I actually ended up liking the OS a lot, which lead to me getting an iPad and apple pencil and also loving those. 
As far as phones though, I won't be switching to an iPhone without some serious changes being made to iOS that I just can't see happening and I have a OnePlus 7 Pro that they'll have to pry from my cold dead hands lmao. It's gonna take a seriously impressive phone even on Android's side of things to get me to switch from this thing

>I like building pcs and technology and phones and all the around but have pretty much nobody to talk to about it.

I totally get that, it sucks to not be able to really share your hobbies and passions as much with your friends and people around you but if you look in the right places you can definitely meet like-minded people to talk about these things with",,1
2186,h8akfh,"I don't get the whole deal with this  iMessage. is it instead of whatsapp? 

like, all the people I know only use whatsapp.. I don't think anyone knows what is even iMessage.. (In my area) 

&#x200B;

Anyway thanks sir",,0
2187,h8akfh,"Yeah, iMessage is the USA version of Whatsapp. On an iPhone, if you are texting other iPhone users, you can chat over iMessage. This means that you get Whatsapp-like features (end-to-end encryption, reactions, read receipts, etc) on those chats. When you send a message to someone else with iMessage, the speech bubble color of your chat is blue. If they don't have an iPhone, the color will be green (indicating SMS). The issue with that is SMS is an inferior experience than iMessage, and many android users are discriminated against due to the ""green bubble"".

Since SMS has been unlimited in the United States (unlike other countries where it's been more expensive), it's stuck around as the norm. Since iPhone users now can chat over iMessage on top of SMS, there's really no reason for them to download another app. Even though Android users have more chat apps, iPhone users don't.

My philosophy on the whole Android-vs-iOS thing is this: People can buy and use whatever phone they want--it's not up to me to dictate what they want. However, discriminating against people with other operating systems is wrong. It's happened to me several times that someone tries to text me and says ""Oh, you don't have an iPhone"". If others don't like the standard SMS experience, either download and use another chat app (Whatsapp, Instagram DMs, Signal, GroupMe, etc) or stop complaining. Nobody should feel bad about the phone they bought.",,1
2188,h8akfh,"Pretty much but 2 corrections: iMessage and SMS always have worked in concert on the platform. When sending a message if iMessage isn’t available, it has always fallen back to SMS (for phone numbers as addresses).

Also, iOS has every chat app that I know about. What messenger app is it missing? WhatsApp, facebook messenger, google hangouts, Microsoft teams, etc etc etc are all on iOS.",,1
2189,h8akfh,"Yeah--I think that seamless integration is part of the problem. Since texting someone with iMessage is the exact same process as texting someone with SMS (i.e. open the Messages app and type in a phone number), the attitude has shifted. People have come to expect iMessage features everywhere (because they are integrated into the normal texting experience) and that causes them to discriminate against Android users.

As far as other apps goes, it is true that alternate, cross-platform chat apps exist on both sides. However, it's not a tech problem anymore--it's a social one. Getting people to download and use a new chat app sounds a little rude (i.e. ""You have to download an entirely new app just for the privilege of messaging me"") and most iPhone will say that ""normal texting just works"". While other chat apps do exist, people just don't want to download them.",,1

Pros of the S10 Lite:

If you use TWS or other Bluetooth earphones primarily then the lack of headphone jack and larger battery help with the Bluetooth connection. If you have issues with your palm accidentally pressing the screen (if you have smaller hands maybe) then the flat screen could help

Pros of the S10 Plus:
If you're often around environments where water or dust is a concern, then the IP rating could be very beneficial. If you're an audiophile then the headphone jack is definitely going to be a benefit with Samsung's SoundAlive and it has a more than decent DAC. 

For screen resolution I would say it's personal preference. Having used larger screen and bezelless phones for a while, I personally don't notice the difference in resolution on anything above 720p unless going from 1080p to 4k.

This post will help you to deal with this problem 


1. Download [App Inspector ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.projectoria.appinspector) app from playstore and locate the apps which you want to remove. Tap on it and you will see the package name of that app. Note down the package name somewhere on a paper. You will need it later on.

2. Download Platform tools and ADB Drivers of your phone on pc.
     i) :- [Plat form tools ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hBMnPhiaSXLDwpsJ2xgW3msevj2Dqpr/view?usp=drivesdk)

     ii) [Universal ADB Drivers ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dTgIS1Ys_uB0DmsTq27dvMaIKFaaepn/view?usp=drivesdk)

3. Enable USB Debugging on your phone. 

4. Connect your phone to your pc via a USB cable and locate ADB Driver folder which you downloaded earlier and run Universal ADB Driver app. It will automatically detect your phone. Now install USB Drivers. 

5. Now go to platform tools folder and open command prompt window here. 

6. Now enter the following commands and after each command press Enter. 
   i) adb devices 
   ii) adb shell
   iii) pm uninstall -k --user 0 name of package

Note :- replace ' name of package' with the package name which you have noted at the 1st step. 

7. By now you would have able to remove the system apps. 

8. If you still have some confusion you can watch my YouTube video on it. Hope this information helps you.

Feature wise the Pixel and OnePlus are slightly ahead of the Z4 (which is the most expensive), but I personally prefer Moto's ambient display over the Pixel. (Haven't used the OnePlus, but I don't think AMOLED lets you use ambient display?) And the Pixel is noticeably smaller than the other two. The Pixel's camera is probably the best of the three, yet has the lowest resolution if you're a pixel-counter. The OnePlus in several areas is the best (highest test scores on things like graphics performance, processor speed, battery) but the Pixel is cheaper and isn't that far behind.",,1

The G8+ should have some pretty great battery life if that's a major concern and a fairly clean build of Android (stock with some nice features). Also has some great audio quality

The Z4 is the one I wouldn't recommend off the list. It's kind of a jack of all trades, but not as good in any area as the others, with everything it does well, another of your choices does better and more 

The Pixel will have the best camera and be supported the longest + monthly security patches. If you can get it, I'd recommend trying to find the XL model though, as the 3 was notably lacking in the battery life department

The 6T is phenomenal software wise with a decent update schedule and can use GCam to take some pretty great photos. Oxygen OS usually has a great battery life as well and under display fingerprint scanners are really convenient

Ooo! You are studying Computer Engineering? Maybe they will teach you, someday, the difference between *memory* (RAM) and *mass storage.* This is a concept we learned in **8th grade Math class. In the 1970s.**

At least, ""Cache are the files that apps downloads to speed up the performance,"" has some potentially true information in it. First, ""cache"" is not a plural word. A program's (app's) cache **is** composed of files used by the program, which yes, might have been downloaded by the app. The files are also *created* by the app.

In larger computers, like a desktop or notebook PC, program cache will be stored in RAM. This is why it helps to have several GB of RAM. I have never written or studied Android programs (apps). Still, I have no doubt they are capable of storing information temporarily in memory (RAM). However, recent Android devices might have as little as 1GB of RAM, as opposed to 4GB or more on a PC. So there is precious little room there to store information.

I can go on, but right now I'm deciding where to post something I already wrote. Don't come at me with this, ""Stop spreading false information,"" garbage.",,0

I mean obviously the TDPs are lower, and you can't maintain maximum clockspeed for more then like 5 minutes on a snapdragon but it's getting there. Occulus vr (Facebook) has a product that uses a snapdragon 835 which is a couple generation's old now. Traditionally you need a $1000 PC to play vr, but the lighter titles seem to work just fine on a arm processor.

I would say if you ever need Industry standard software like Cad, CS6, blender, davinchi resolve or something like that is when you really want to make that investment these days.",,1

obviously i have no idea how yall program stuff but that should just be an obvious example. dviewsitevar could be an array that holds the boolean value for desktop mode for any given site in a file.

u could have a client-side file storing any given website name (reduced to the first part i.e. reddit.com or etc.gov or whatever)), followed by the ""number""/order it was stored (to be read for websitenumber)/added to settings as always being desktop

I sold my old working Nexus 5X on eBay. Before I posted it, I dutifully factory reset the device and sent it on its merry way. When the buyer received it, he tried to login to the phone with his Google account, but it was locked to the previous owner (i.e. me!). Long story short, I should have _removed_ my Google account from the device _before_ I reset the phone. Reason being, it would be easy for someone to steal your phone, factory reset it and then it's theirs.

The guy seemed really nice so I took a massive gamble and gave him my username and password. He phoned me and we logged him in live on the phone. The moment his account was loading up, I went into _my_ Google account and immediately changed the password and also deactivated and reactivated two factor authentication. I also centrally logged myself out of every device my Google account was logged into. Lesson learned!

Google's replacement for GP, ""Youtube Music"" refuse's to touch my 200gb+ library of music on the sd card so that got trashed about 5min after Google forced it's install. I don't see the point in wasting my limited data on streaming music when giant SD cards are so cheap...",,1
2949,h03jlx,"As someone who has done this, MANY times, a few thoughts.

First, you are currently an apple person, so you are not used to the android controls. Find a friend, or better yet a few friends, who have been android users for a while, at least a couple of years. See if one of them has a phone they upgraded from they do not want, Free is always the best, especially when you are just trying this, first attempt.  Make sure they do not mind if you ask them questions.

Wipe the data on that phone, it is not hard at all to do, just google factory data reset (model of phone), always do a full reset on a phone you just acquired, it is the safest way to go.

while you are googling, read how to put an SD card in, go buy the biggest one that phone will support and you can justify spending the money for.  I just bought a couple of 128 Gig cards for like 26.00, I think it was from Costco, not sure.

Get your accounts set up, ask questions if you need to. I usually install Pandora, Spotify, Youtube, Simple audio book player, ( I listen to audio books a lot) and whatever music player is highly rated in the play store right now. There are a lot of players, if one annoys you uninstall it and try a different one.

Drag a bunch of music onto it and have fun!

Android has a lot more options then you are used to, ask questions when you get confused, ask for advice.",,1

3002,gzvouo,"Out of the devices you listed, forget the Samsung, it *only* has a single 13mp camera.

Forget the Nokia, it's not a *new* device, it was released in 2018.

The Moto has a dual camera set up and on paper has the better camera specs, but there are some other budget devices that have dual camera set ups, and using the new camera go app from Google gives some very good results.

Whilst I'm not a new parent, I am a new grandfather and I'm using an Alcatel 3 (2019) (£90 in UK) with a dual camera set up (13mp / 2mb + 8mp selfie) and using the Google app makes all the difference to the image quality.

Using the stock Alcatel camera app leaves poor results with light, saturation and colour depth.",,1
3003,gzvouo,"Honestly it's up to you on what you consider as acceptable. Maybe 5 years ago the camera on lower end devices now would be considered flagship level. The question is, where would you be coming from in terms of phone camera. Would the cameras on these phones be worse or better than what you previously considered acceptable?  


Also, think of this: I have an S20, and while I still take better pics than my mom's A51, the pictures from the A51 are very acceptable quality to me, and I've only used Notes and S phones for most of my smartphone life.

Google Camera changes the processing to something better. Google Camera Go is actually available for download as an apk, so even if the phone didn't come with it, you can take advantage of it.",,1

3005,gzvouo,"It would be easier for you to download the Google camera go apk to your device and test, as posting camera images to Google drive or imagur to link here make them compressed and loose quality which doesn't show you the benefits of the Google camera app.

Just another heads up, these Alcatel (TCL) devices don't receive Android or regular security updates, the 2019 pie model I have has been replaced (in UK) with a 3X 2020 variant running Android 10.
The 2019 model I have is now on sale for £89 (down from £149) and will soon be discontinued.


The new flagship is the TCL 10 (£200) and it appears the Alcatel branding is now slowly being dropped from use.

Downloading the camera go apk is a much better solution to purchasing a new device and being disappointed with the camera after a few hours use.",,1

3024,gzpbv9,"It actually *is* an app issue: they need to register an intent (Android term) that tells the operating system they want to handle files of that type. Once the intent is registered, when you try to open the file, Android will check the registered intents and either open it directly (if there's only one app that matches, or you've chosen a default) or prompt you (if there are multiple and you haven't chosen a default). If they haven't registered an intent for those files, Android doesn't know they're able to handle them.

Intents are part of the app's code, so unless you are developing this app, you can't really do anything about it.",,1

3026,gzpbv9,"What phone, and which OS version? Is it older (or newer) than other devices you know work?

*Have you opened the app on your phone since you installed it?* It's possible that it hasn't registered its intents and permissions with the OS yet, if you haven't opened it at least once.

If you long-press on the app icon and choose App Info (circled i) > Advanced > Open by default, is the top section a) enabled and b) not set to ""Don't open in this app""?

Apparently there aren't really any good intent-viewers in the Play Store. But if you found one, the application manifest (where it also registers all the permissions it needs, etc.) should include a section called <intent-filters> that includes a list of MIME types it supports. For example, the application manifest for Amazon Kindle includes intents for `application/pdf`, etc. so you can open PDF files with Kindle even though they're not Kindle files.",,1
