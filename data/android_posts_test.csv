0,Automatic dark mode went missing after a restart,hfenbw,2020-06-25 02:47:32,"This week, the system update to QPKS30.54-22-9 (Android 10) and it was fine up until today. In the afternoon, the phone spazzed out (Motorola One, bought in 2019) and would pass the first few seconds of startup. 
After a while trying to reset it, I was successful, but the battery was showing 0%. So I restarted it in Safe Mode once, still nothing. Restarted it again (by turning it off, then on), I think it automatically started in normal mode and the battery gauge was working again. 
In the night time, I noticed none of the apps entered dark mode automatically and the option went missing from the Developer Settings, I had to manually select the dark theme from the Screen Settings.

TL;DR: Automatic Dark Theme according to time went missing from Developer Mode

Any ideas on who to activate automatic dark mode for the whole system again?",,1,1.0

53,Dorling Kindersley Visual Dictionary — Obtaining a text version of app data,hey3o9,2020-06-24 09:37:02," 

I'm terrible with technical terminology and not fantastic with  technology generally. I've tried a few searches in the forum and nothing  came up with the search items I was using so apologies if this has been  asked already.

I have a series of visual dictionaries for various languages I am  fluent in/studied or are currently studying that exist as both physical  books, PDFs and an app on my Samsung. The app allows you download the  audio for every entry in the dictionary (roughly 6000 entries) in your  chosen target language and then use the dictionary via the app.

For reference, the app is called ""DK Bilingual Visual Dictionary""  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dk.bvdaudioapp&hl=en\_AU](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dk.bvdaudioapp&hl=en_AU)

What I am currently working on is putting together an excel  spreadsheet so I can create a deck on my flashcard program for my own  use. The spreadsheet/flashcard has a field each for \[English\], the  \[Target Language\]s (a column/field each for each language.) and \[Audio\].

I have worked out how to access the audio files but what I now need  to do is have a list of all the \[English\] and \[Target Language\]/s  entries and correlate these to the audio. Unfortunately, the audio files  are titled along the lines of:

DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis010diemen\_001.m4a  
DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis012derkor\_002.m4a  
DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis012derkor\_004.m4a  
DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis012derkor\_007.m4a

They are separated by chapter (the numbers in the middle) but there  is no real logic with the ordering (the final number of the file name).

Also, to obtain the full list of entries, I will need to take screen  shots of each page on my Android phone or on my iPad and then run this  through my OCR software.

What I am hoping is that there is a way of somehow accessing the text  of an app and I can then manipulate the data on Excel. As an example,  something that might read:

{{English:Dog}}blahblahblah{{German:Der Hund}}blahblah{{Audio:DK Visual Dictionary\\German\\bvd\_englis010diemen\_001.m4a}}

As you can see from my use of ""blah blah"" for technical speak, this is way beyond my limited IT skills ;)

The only alternative is to then listen to every sound file in one  target language, compare against the english audio and then refer to the  audio file name although fortunately I should only need to do this one  as the file names are the same in every language.

For reference, I have paid for the books, have purchased a few  E-Books and have downloaded the app and this is solely for my own use.

Thanks in advance for any advice anyone can give.",,1,1.0

It runs on a modified version of Android 4.2.2 (you can actually get to the Jelly Bean Easter egg on a TV!). There's a built in Netflix app that works well with the remote.

Recently, the Netflix app has started loading, before hitting a blank white screen that says ""file not found."" I have tried unplugging it, connecting to different WiFi, clearing the cache, disabling and reenabling, and even factory resetting the TV. 

Because it's on Android, there's a Google play store, but downloading Netflix bizarrely gets a different app. The downloaded one has a white logo, instead of the TV's default red one, and doesn't work at all with the remote - you have to use the pointing feature like it's a Wii remote.

79,"Why, oh why, does Android's WiFi tethering go around the phone's VPN, even when you have ""Always on VPN"" and ""Block all non-VPN traffic"" in the VPN settings?",her7tw,2020-06-24 01:05:39,"I use a mainstream US VPN provider just for a tiny amount of anonymity on the web, and so my cell provider can't see every site I go to. I just feel like that's an invasion of privacy. I also figured that if I tethered another device to my phone, it would just look like normal traffic from my phone. I used to use it on my home internet, too, but I don't have that now since I'm traveling.

But today, quite by accident, I learned that the WiFi hotspot feature on my phone is ignoring my VPN connection! I ran a speed test on my tethered PC just to see what I get and was alarmed that it said ""AT&T Wireless"" as my provider instead of some random ISP name my VPN vendor uses. If I search ""my ip"" on both my phone and PC I get different results. 

Why is this possible? Why does tethering traffic go around the VPN? 

I've been tethering like this for months. Ever since I learned that I can get full speed if I tether a DD-WRT-equipped router to my phone instead of my other devices directly. If I tether my devices directly, I get capped at 128 kbps speeds. Presumably because Cricket can figure out that they are not requests from my phone. I knew about PdaNet for a long time, and that gives me full speed, too, but it's flaky, I would have to reconnect a lot, and only works for some devices. I tried using my router in split client-router mode for a reason I can't even remember and was really surprised that doing so gave all my devices full speed. So now I have my tablet, PC, and even my Roku tethered to my phone through my router. I figured since my phone used the always-on VPN with ""Block non-VPN traffic"", I was fine. :(

So, now I'm worried that my provider (which is actually Cricket which uses AT&T networks) is going to catch on that I've been tethering. They supposedly only allow it with ""compatible phones"", and with a 15 GB limit. (I think you can pay for more *a la carte*.) I used over 100 GB of tethering just last month. It's not unreasonable to use that much as a heavy phone internet user with streaming video, heavy reddit app usage, and miscellaneous downloads, so I figured my VPN gave me plausible deniability. Well, not any more.

(I can use OpenVPN from within the DD-WRT firmware to negate the issue going forward, but that doesn't really help now, since I'm sure they have logs.)

How fucked am I if they figure it out? Could they drop me without warning and make me lose the phone number I've had all my life? And why TF does Android not use my VPN for tethering traffic?",,1,1.0

>I applied the setting with a timeout of 250, pop up menu feels super responsive (fast). 

I have a Note 8 (N950F), rooted and custom recovery. Android 8.0.0

I read a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/h9x99k/if_you_were_having_trouble_copying_and_pasting/) about customizing the ""Touch and hold delay"" which affects the time it takes the phone to pop up a shortcut menu ( like the copy - paste ..etc. when you select a text, press and hold).

In a nutshell, the settings menu does not allow customizing that delay below 0.5 seconds, need to find accessibility settings storage location in the file system, I tried searching by package name for settings app in /data/data .. found nothing.

**More details:**

I found the ""Touch and hold delay"" under settings > Accessibility > Dexterity and interaction

it has 4 options  
Short (0.5 seconds)  
Medium (1.0 seconds)  
Long (1.5 seconds)  
Custom

When I select custom, it presents a screen where I have to touch and hold a circle for the custom desired time. The problem is any touch and hold time less that 0.5 seconds does not allow saving, only when you touch and hold longer than 0.5 seconds it lights up the save button!

TL;DR: does it work? How?

But I'd love to be able to turn off notifications for all work related apps on weekends or during vacation.

Been searching for some time, some say Samsung Knox Secure Folder could do that, but haven't found clear tutorial, and apparently you need to create Samsung account for that. All official android tutorials require android enterprise MDM, which we don't have in the company.

I have a Samsung Galaxy A10e and I've had it since January. No spills or hard falls, yet it has somehow stopped charging normally. I've tried cleaning the charger point out along with the charger itself to no avail. The issue started sometime after the most recent update though I didn't think much of it as I know it's rarely software updates that cause these things. It was usually fixable, but now it is not. It doesn't seem like my charger port is bent (gap is there) and I'm not sure what the issue is. 

For reference, it says that it is always charging even when it isn't plugged in. It is not the charger that it came with and I don't know what happened to that one (I've moved since January) either, but it's always been compatible until recently.

190,How do you disable bluetooth auto connect??,hdn2du,2020-06-22 06:43:20,"I feel like this would be a standard feature from 5 or 6 years ago and am blown away that there literally just isn't an option to disable this.

I have a bluetooth FM transmitter in my car for listening to music through my phone on a car that is a little older and bluetooth earbuds.

I walk my dog a lot. I turn on bluetooth. I go outside. It connects to my car.  I swap to my earbuds. It decides I actually made a mistake and kindly reconnects to my car. I, again, choose my earbuds.

I start the walk. I make it back to my street. About 2 houses away, it once again decides that I actually want to use bluetooth in my car and automatically swaps to my car. I swap back. I walk into my kitchen, still listening to music.

""Hey, I noticed you were within one hundred meters of your car. Let me go ahead and swap to your car."" says bluetooth.

I finally give up and turn my music off.

Next day:

I get into my car. I turn bluetooth on. It TURNS MY EARBUDS ON from being shut off and connects to them instead of my car.  I manually swap back. This happens again during my drive.

I'm sitting at work. I want to make a phone call. It turns my earbuds on and decides to use those. I ultimately shut bluetooth off.

I go into settings. Silly me, obviously theres a way to turn off bluetooth automatic connecting feature on a 2020 smart phone, right?

20 forum posts later, nope. There isn't. Bluetooth will just connect to whatever it wants, whenever it wants.

Any suggestions??",,2,1.0

About 2 months ago I switched my Amazon music app from saving music to my external SD card to internal space, this was in response to getting somewhat close to filling up my SD card with just music.

According to the Samsung My Files app, the SD is filled with ""other"". I looked into it and it turns out that a folder named Android is taking up a large chunk of space on the card.

**I have an LG Rebel 4 LTE phone running Android 8.1 (Oreo).** My problem is simple, but confusing, I already knew how to access the language and input settings to change a language, but like I said, it only told me I had English and Spanish to choose from. I decided to look for tutorials online, maybe thinking that I was somehow going to the wrong place, but even tutorials using the same exact version of android that I have had access to all kinds of languages.  
I also use the google keyboard, which does allow for Korean input, but that's different from my base android settings.

One thing I find interesting (which you can see in the screenshot I provide) is that the Spanish setting says ""United States"", making me believe that maybe just because I'm in the United States, that I can only choose languages from the United States? That doesn't make sense to me considering people from other countries move here all the time and would like to use things in their native language.

Talking to an IT guy they said if I felt like it since I dont have my own phone for backup if anything ever goes wrong, they are cool with me using my own phone with their sim card (which is a nano) and either using that as a backup in case something breaks or vice versa.

RELEVANT INFORMATION:

Had this issue for many years across many Android phones: Galaxy S6 Edge+, Note 7, Pixel 2 XL, Note 9, and Note 10. Doubt it's a Samsung-specific issue because of that Pixel.

Each of the aforementioned phones ran a different version of the OS and were always updated as updates were made available. None of my phones were rooted at any point.

The device I try texting to doesn't seem to make a difference either, be it another Android phone or an iPhone, with a couple exceptions: texting from a Samsung phone with Samsung's messaging app set as the default to another Samsung phone with Samsung's messaging app set as the default never gave me problems; and I haven't had problems texting any Android phone since Google rolled out Chat features as long as both of us are using Google's messaging app as the default.

I don't always know which carrier the receiving device is on, but I can confirm the issue exists when texting AT&T or T-mobile customers. It's safe to assume Verizon or any other carrier would behave similarly.

The issue also occurs whether the recipient's device or my device are connected via Wi-Fi, LTE, or 3G.

My mobile carrier is the only constant. I've had the same T-Mobile USA account for the duration of my time with Android phones. In case it makes any difference, I switched T-Mobile rate plans once about two years ago.

284,I want to understand Instagram (ELI5),hcrao2,2020-06-20 18:33:47,"Maybe this is not the right place and please direct me where to post something like that. I just want to understand more (out of curiosity) how Instagram works and why it has lower quality Stories on Android. 

I was watching the latest [Mrwhostheboss video](https://youtu.be/165bpjQ2ZNs) and he talked about how instagram have lower quality stories on Android and I guess the same goes for photos taken directly from Instagram app, and started to wondering why on a more technical level and would like to be educated more.

First I understand that Instagram develop for each iOS device and that's why it works better on iOS, and the reason is that there are a lot of Android devices to develop for them all. I understand that, and I'm not saying they should do that . But, why doesn't Instagram, instead of talking to the phone camera directly, talk to the camera app on this phone, I understand that would be a very big hassle again, but it will have to be developed to talk to a number of apps (samsung camera app, Gcam, Huawei camera app, etc) I'm not sure how different each specific app (samsung camera app for example) from model to model, but I think they have the general same export coding (correct me if I'm wrong)? Is this because they won't be able to implement their Ai filter and such on top of it or are there other reasons? and if so, If google would to add a universal G-service that can apply AI to the export of these apps ,providing manufacturer of the mobile write the code for, to work as a middle man between the native camera app ,with all the driver support and such, and Instagram app to talk to Instagram directly without developers of Instagram having to do the heavy lifting, would Instagram accept something like this or will facebook deny giving in for google to handle such processing against giving better quality for Instagram users? also how hard would it be for google to provide something like this service? I mean from what I know apps like uber already uses similar service for location and maps

Finally, I'm not a developer but I want to understand more why the problem that there are too many android phones affects apps like instagram and what'sapp voice notes, but not other apps like apps that rely on haptic feedback for example which are different from phone to phone too. or apps that requires things that vary from phone to phone ? 

There might be an obvious answer that I'm not aware of, and seem dumb, but I'm really curious",,5,1.0

I'm usually just someone who lurks around this subreddit to read some information regarding android. I've been following UK attempt to implement this system and how they decided to transition to the service Apple and Google are going to provide.

Well, I bought a OP 7T Pro and I found out - because someone I know mentioned it to me - that I have the feature already installed but deactivated (I think) on my phone.

I don't live in the UK, even though my phone came from there. Does anyone (specifically from the UK) also have this feature? Wasn't it suppose to be an app?

To explain exactly, I dropped my phone in some water, basically just the upper part. I took it out quickly, wiped it up and (because I didn't know better) put it in rice overnight. That didn't do anything obviously, so after seeing it wasn't turning on this morning I opened up the back. I wiped the visible water with tissue paper and spent some time drying it with a hair dryer. I then left it open to air dry more for a few hours. When I could see no more condensation anywhere ( like on the lens of the front camera), I tried to turn it on again. 

It turned on fine, but there's an inch or so of water that got in a corner of the display area and it's visible.  I turned it back off, put it on its side on a tissue so the water would have somewhere to possibly come out. 

I asked a phone service out of curiosity if I did the right thing and they just said I should bring it ASAP - now, I don't know if it's cause of course they want to make money or just telling the truth. The cost of cleaning for liquid contact is pretty high and I'm not sure I can afford it right now.  So I'd like a few other opinions before I dish out the money I don't have :(",,0,0.5

I mean of course there are apps in playstore for that but if there is a convenient root solution possible for this that would be great.

The idea is simple. Like you swipe down, you bring down your notification/control center and at the bottom is a brightness slider, instead or just add an option for volume slider. Like in IOS control center. 

Now i can't use the typical iOS control center thing on my phone since I'm using OP6T android 10 oxygen os. Gesture based navigation (with swipe from left/right to go back)

I would always prefer a volume slider instead of a brightness slider or just an option to add two sliders.


The thing is, i hate using buttons, additionally i have a hard case on my phone so the buttons are hard to use.

I wish to operate my phone without any buttons, at all, i can open and close the screen, but there are times like i could adjust volume while listening to music, since Spotify doesn't provide that. 

This maybe a small thing for most people but this is exactly why i would've loved to use an iPhone 8 atleast. When you could easily access all your needs by swiping from bottom.

Its hard to imagine how everyone feels fine with this? No one genuinely cares about this? Especially those who have bad volume buttons or broken buttons. I hate to rely on buttons. This feels very, ancient. Especially when you have long phones, to reach the top with your finger in long phones is quite an inconvenience.

This is of course a very first world problem, but i guess in a world where people are trying to make everything as convenient as possible.. why not this?

Because of the growing tech, I'm so confused where to start with, I'm sure this is not a common syndrome, y'all must have successfully gone through times like these, kudos to you there!

I was taught C and Python at my university. After a bit of research, I have planned to start learning JAVA, and Android Studio. But my bad the internet has a lot of information, sometimes it's scary. I happen to come across ReactNative, which is definitely a cool platform to build applications with.

I'm sure there will be many more out there, I'm not preferring to learn Kotlin, I made my mind to learn either Java or ReactNative.

But here comes the problem, which one to use. If I had to use just Java and Android Studio, that would be great for me, but what about Cross-platform issues, I mean if I had to make my App available for iOS, etc, what framework would help me if I use Java. I got to know I can use Flutter with Dart. But that doesn't help my problem out, because without learning Java it is not easy to learn Dart/Kotlin.

Recently my friend told me about problems with apps (mainly banking apps, but also some other apps) -- some of them refuse to perform some operations (or refuse to work at all) on AOSP-based or rooted firmwares.

I'd like to note that it's not like VLC on desktop that can be compiled to refuse to run as root -- these apps refuse to run if the user isn't restricted enough on their own device.

Some people say that ""itsforsecurity"" -- but desktop operating systems give you root (or administrator in Windows) during the installation process. Why are desktop versions of these same applications that don't run on rooted mobile devices, don't care about root on desktop?

Each one that fails gets stuck at a specific percentage, which sometimes changes if I clear Download Manager data, and sometimes doesn't. The notification from Download Manager vanishes from the list at the moment the download freezes, which leads me to guess that it's crashing.

My list of pending updates just keeps growing because it's so hard to deal with.

There has not been a system update for around 6 months, so it doesn't make any sense for a system app to start crashing recently.

The tablet is very intentionally not rooted (if that's even possible), I bought it for the purpose of playing games I can't play on my rooted phone. 

Some things I have tried:

* Force stop the Play Store and re-launch it: Helps with downloads stuck at 100%, but not any at a lesser percentage.
* Stop and Clear data for the Play Store
* Stop and Clear data for the Download Manager: Sometimes helps, but not often enough. If I don't stop the Play Store this also brings up a ""can't download"" error, but that doesn't change anything.
* Stop and clear data for all three of Play Store, Download Manager, and Google Play Services, then reboot: Still happens.

So, Anyone got any ideas? I **really** don't want to factory reset, since unrooted Android has no functional way to backup my apps and their data.

Since I couldn't really find a version for the A6 and wanted to fully use all Nethunter tools, which the ""Lite"" version does not have like HID attacks or WIFI injections, I just tried to flash the Nethunter zip for the OnePlus 3 since it is for android 9 pie. It all installed without problems except for the kernel package. Well yeah it runs lol. But a lot of things don't seem to work propperly, like metasploit, postgresql, WiGLE wifi does not sync or show the map. I installed the right custom kernel for the Galaxy J7 that Kali Nethunter promotes, which is very identical to the A6 but it didn't change too much.

494,how to automate or silently configure device?,haossk,2020-06-17 10:43:19,"Hallo,

I'm a big fan of all possibilities to automate things so that I can prepare some script or configuration file and then use it multiple times to achieve reproducable results.

I'd like to do some configuration after the initial setup, or maybe even automate the initial setup completely by providing necessary stuff in a response file.

It is so great to setup Linux or Windows unattended, and I'd like to do the same for my family's smartphones. Android does this - to an extent - by offering to restore from a previous device setup, but this option leaves out the most (for me) tedious task: setting up multiple email accounts.

What I mean is setting up the account, WiFi, and some more like setting some particular config items for the keyboard, display, notifications, ringtones, some privacy settings, more email accounts.

I tried Google Business G Suite but (to my understanding) explicitly says it does not push sensitive information like passwords - but that's exactly what I'd want to do - fully configure email accounts including pop/imap/ssl/smtp/password settings.

Is this feasible? When searching the web I find a lot of automation tools but for operating, not for setting up.

It would appear to be new old-stock as it still has the factory protector on the screen and no scratches whatsoever.

It comes with a few basic application, but the Play Store is not present. This is a situation I've found myself in before, and what I usually do is go to APKMirror and download the latest Play Store APK as well as the latest Google Play Services. Once both are installed it usually works.

Not this time, though - I just get the ""sign in"" button that doesn't work and a three-dots menu that gets me in a very sparse settings menu if I click ""settings"" and crashes the play store if I click ""updates"".

This isn't going to be some hacky performance machine, just a light-duty tab for watching films and occasional light Internet use, so worse comes to worst I can just sideload everything off of APKmirror - but that way I wouldn't get any updates unless I downloaded everything manually every time, which I can *not* be arsed doing.

I already know that Flash doesn't have an Android app nor does Android does need an app for viewing flash content. So, I basically said ""FOH"" and clicked cancel. A short while later, another download prompt showed up asking me if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk"" as ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" already existed.

Obviously, I clicked cancel again, closed the site, backed out of Chrome entirely and began searching through my files. There was nothing in my downloads folder that was named ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" at all. There were, however, three randomly named ""part"" files in there which were created literally a minute before I started looking through my files (according to the details at least).

So I deleted the three part files and, to be on the safe side, I decided to revist the site to see if I could retrigger the download prompt. I know, that was probably stupid, but again, there was no ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" in my files, only the three last files. I figured that if it came again asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" then I'd know I got rid of it by deleting the part files.

But, when I went to the site again, the download prompt came up asking if I wanted to download ""AdobeFlashPlayer (2).apk."" instead. I NOOOOPED out of that again, closed the site, closed Chrome, and forced stopped Chrome.

So here is where my problem comes in.

I checked my downloads folder again and it's completely empty. I enabled ""Show Hidden Files"" and nothing comes up. I went and searched through the Chrome app data on both my phone and my SD Card and still nothing.

I opened up Chrome again and checked the download history and strangely enough, there was a ongoing download for ""AdobeFlashPlayer.apk"" that I most certainly did NOT agree to. Chrome said that it was ""downloading"" the file and had downloaded 11.8MB out of 11.8MB. It seemed to be stuck trying to finish downloading the file, however. I watched it for like 30 seconds and it never seemed to finish. It also had the broken thumbnail icon next to it that (at least from what I've seen) comes up when Chrome tries and fails to download something or the file it downloaded is no longer in the folder Chrome downloaded it into.

There was an X next to the download that I clicked on to cancel the download, which it did, thankfully but it also just removed it from the list without telling me where it was downloading from or to.

I get that I'm probably, for all intents and purposes, fine since it looks like I interrupted it mid-download but I NEVER agreed to download this thing (Chrome didn't even let me know it was downloading the file) and that has me concerned.

What else can I do to make sure that this thing is legit gone?",,2,0.75

I have been wracking my brain over this for two days now, and I've decided to just ask the question. 

Backstory: My best Bros birthday is this weekend, he has kids and thus cant enjoy gaming as he once did. He plays teamfight tactics and legends of runeterra.

Now the question/issue, the first game Teamfight tactics can only run on a 64bit OS. So I was looking into a Samsung tab a 10.1, but after reviews I saw it was ""64-bit ARMv8-A(32 bit mode). As I do not have any tablets with this chipset/bit OS. I am unable to test. 

Could someone explain the difference in the ""32-bit mode on a 64 bit OS"", and just a 64 bit android OS?

Also since it says 32 bit mode does that mean it has the libraries to run 64 bit apps, meaning the mode auto switches?

Sorry if this is confusing, as I don't truly understand the architecture it's difficult to ask the question.

Android: version 10

After a recent update, my schedule text message feature quit working correctly. I have many health issues and heavily rely on this feature to communicate with my family. If someone could help it would be so appreciated.

The problem: The texts now send at random times as opposed to their scheduled times. For example, if I would schedule three texts at 7:00, 7:01, and 7:02, respectively, they would each send at that exact time. Now they might send at 7:06, 7:15, and 7:24. Basically the pattern has been: first text sends at completely random time, then each subsequent text schedules nine minutes after the last one. 

I also used to schedule three texts at one time, say 10:00am, but instead of all sending at 10:00 like they used to, they all break up and send at random times as well. Depending on what I'm trying to communicate, it's important they get sent at specified time.

I've used this feature for years on all my previous phones and this one, never a problem until last update.I can't find anyone to help because most people didn't even know this schedule text feature existed, even though its been available for quite some time.

601,Problem with mobile networks after Android 10 update.,h9pq4w,2020-06-15 21:51:59,"Hello!
Since I have updated my Xiaomi MI A2 to Android 10 in January earlier this year, I am experiencing issues with my mobile network.

My carrier actually uses the network of another carrier, so in order to have mobile data working properly, a user has to:

1. enable roaming
2. turn off automatic network selection and select the carrier, which provides the network for them.

The problem appears when I want to turn the second option off. My phone returns me a message, saying: ""Couldn't find networks. Try again.""
I was able to make this change on Android 9, but since the phone has been updated, the network selection just does not work for me.

Looks like I am not the only one experiencing this issue. Another user, who owns a different phone and the same carrier  has also reported to me that he had very similar issues after updating to Android 10

My question is, whether anyone has experienced same issue after updating to the latest version of Android and if anyone knows what could fix the issue apart from downgrading the software.

I will appreciate all of your answers.

So yesterday I went to the grocery store, unplugged my phone as I normally would and came back to my truck.

I followed the prompted steps, gave it a shake and let it air dry for about 1.5 hours. The icon was still in my notification bar, so I let it sit with a blow dryer about 2 feet away on the low/cool setting for roughly 30 minutes. My Usb port had to be dry and I even checked it pretty thoroughly considering. I saw several videos and threads online saying to restart your phone with the charging cable plugged in and the icon/notification would go away and I charge my s8+ via charging cable.

# The problem

  
So the thing is that I have a Bluetooth headphone but its microphone is so horrible people can't understand me if I use it. So I'd like to use it only for output, and internal microphone as input on Discord.  
I know there are a lot of threads about this but either they don't work for me or there isn't any solution on it.

# Solution #1

  
I thought about installing pulseaudio but  
\- it doesn't seem stable  
\- I don't know if it could allow me to do this (could it?)

# Solution #2

  
I also thought about another solution which could be disabling external microphones making them unusable at all, but I don't know if it's possible, and if it is, how?

# Solution #3

  
I also thought about preventing Android to detect the microphone on the headphones, making them recognized without microphone.

# Solution #4

  
Or I could make an application which allow me to do it, but how? Is it possible? It doesn't seem to be.

So I make a 3rd group, and looking at it now, there is only 3 contacts in the group, so I don't think the 4th person is getting what I am sending.  To top this off, one of the people texted me stating that she is experiencing the exact same thing as me.

Now the phone is in use for some general YouTube watching by a seemingly harmless user (other than my watch history is sometimes very... strange). I was wondering if there is any way to leverage control over the Google account it is logged on to find/disable the device completely or find out the identity of the user. I imagine since the phone is still connected to the Google account it couldn't have been completely wiped. So most likely still has my data (and also my SD card).

The device is a Xiaomi Redmi 7. Now thinking it *might've* been a mistake, I have also already removed the device from my Mi account.

It is a long shot and tbh I just find it hard to burn this last bridge, as the whole ordeal with the burglary and it being the first phone I bought as a functioning adult has been intense for me.

653,Kinda Nervous--Two versions of Google Photos on my Phone?,h93m14,2020-06-14 22:50:15,"*EDIT: Problem solved. It was a shortcut to the web version.*

I don't normally launch apps from my app drawer, as all of the major ones I use are shortcuts in folders in my homescreen tray.  With that said, I was browsing through my app drawer to see if I could free up some space by uninstalling apps, and I happened to notice two different Google Photos apps--one called **Google Photos**, and one called **Photos**.

I have the **Photos** app as a shortcut on my homescreen, so that one looked normal to me when I opened it.  I then opened **Google Photos** and things looked...a bit off.

There was a launch screen with the Google Photos icon on a white background (my phone is set to dark mode), and it said ""Google Photos"" at the bottom of the launch screen in Roboto Condensed, black font.  I know Google uses that font for things, but it just didn't seem ""Google official"" because I also know they don't use black text on their launch screens, and any font would be Product Sans.

Opening the app looked pretty official.  All of my photos and videos, even ones I had taken just minutes before, showed up, and the menu on the side had all of my regular account settings.  Aside from the fact that it wasn't in dark mode, everything there looked legit.

I went back to my app drawer, long tapped the **Google Photos **icon, and looked at the version.  Version 82.  The official **Photos** app I have is 4.51.0.315203446.

When in the info screen, I saw that the **Google Photos** app did say it was installed from the Google Play Store.  When I tapped that, it took me to the store, but it could not find the app.  I immediately uninstalled it, ran SD Maid, and then came here to post.

There were too many strikes against the **Google Photos** app to make me comfortable.  It had a slightly different looking splash screen.  It didn't follow the dark mode theme of my phone.  It was version 82.

I very rarely download anything on my phone maybe other than menus from restaurants, and I don't browse any sketchy websites.  The only unofficial app I have ever downloaded is the modded [QuickPic app from the XDA forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/mod-gallery-quickpic-based-4-7-4-t3790425).

666,-repeat- could my android have malware or been rooted without me knowing?,h8yhvm,2020-06-14 18:03:07,"I was looking through a younger siblings tablet the other day and I found a folder called ‘data’ then another folder called ‘data’. once you clicked it the top where the names are of the things you have been clicking is the name of a game in the format of ‘com.—whatever game—‘. the folders in the second ‘data’ folder were two folders named ‘head’ and I believe ‘service chat logs’. in the folder ‘head’ there were selfies of maybe five different people and two pictures that weren’t faces. The beginning of each of the pictures begins with either cache or cached and random numbers. two and a half years ago I used their tablet to go onto a chat app I frequently went on, since my phone was broke at the time. I can’t say for certain, but one of the photos looked kind of familiar, but as I said I can’t be for certain. the others I don’t really recognize.

When I tried to click the two files in the ‘chat service logs’ which were named that as well, I didn’t see their full names but they at least began with that. They couldn’t be opened due to I believe not having the app installed. I deleted that app on their 2+ years ago. I just wanted to bring this up because if it was from my app, why would it be under a folder that doesn’t have the apps name? also no other things were available in the data folder. I read online and saw that if you can access the two data folders that your device is rooted? I doubt a five year old could root a device, unless by accident? my other sibling took the sims card out a few months ago, could this be the reason? I just wanted to make sure there was no malware or anything that could have had access to the camera or microphone. that’s really the only suspicious stuff I saw. I believe we have always had that little box not clicked that says if we want to allow other apps that aren’t from google play. so I don’t think it was an outside app, but my sibling would sometimes play low quality games that I think were tailored to kids due to the amount of ads they would throw in. if anyone could give any insight that would be great, thanks! sorry for the repeated posts, but stuff like this scares me especially if there was the ability to access the microphone or camera without our knowledge.",,0,0.33

691,Is there a way to make an installed app think the phone is not rooted ?,h8q5s0,2020-06-14 08:44:27,"Hello.

I would like to know if it's possible to make an installed app think the phone isn't rooted ? I have a OnePlus X rooted phone and when I've installed my bank app, a pop up window has appeared and said ""Information : this app can't work with rooted phone.. please unroot your phone to let the app work.""

I don't want to unroot my OnePlus X but I need to use this app. So how to deal with this two conditions ? Can I fake an unroot mod for this specific app ?

If not possible, what's the best way to unroot my OnePlus X without erase my phone, custom rom.

Thank you guys.

700,Question About LG X Charge,h8ms06,2020-06-14 03:57:50,"Hi! Sorry if this is a dumb question, I've been Googling and can't find the information I need. 

I live in America, use Cricket Wireless, and I have an LG X Charge purchased December 2018 and running Android 7.0. I just need to know whether or not this is a 64-bit device. Niantic, the company behind Pokemon Go, is [dropping support for 32-bit phones](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/11/pokemon-go-is-dropping-support-for-32-bit-android-phones/) at the beginning of August. It may seem inconsequential, but Pokemon Go has become a huge part of my life over the past year and a half. It's the main way my partner and I make time to spend with each other, a way we can go out and enjoy ourselves without spending money, and the cornerstone of our main group of friends. So losing access to it would be a pretty big personal blow, and I want to know if I can keep my current phone (which is just chugging along no problem, wasn't even going to replace it until next year at the earliest) or if I should start saving up now for a new one.

I'm on a super strict budget, so my phone was deliberately pretty low-end. I checked the specs of it to try to figure it out, and the LG X Charge does appear to have a 64-bit processor. But, I was told to use AIDA64 and look for ""x64"" or ""-64"" in the kernel version, and I was told my phone would not be 64-bit if it wasn't there. It isn't, which just confused me. If it's that my phone is 64-bit but my current OS isn't, is there a way that I could get my current OS to be 64-bit, or am I just out of luck? Thanks so much in advance!

How do i patch the boot.img file before flashing to phone?  I know of Magisk but this needs to be installed on the phone and it only patches the current boot.img installed on the phone not one on a computer before loaded to phone.

Sorry to sound like an idiot. I have rooted a phone before ( Moto X Pure )
and it worked well.
This phone tho is newer and uncharted territory for me. There were programs and such for the X Pure
when i did it. This seems to be a command (adb) process only.

Finally, is there a different logo.img I can use ( I assume this is the boot animation file). Is this done via adb commands? 

I honestly do not want to brick this phone by being stupid. When I had my other phone TWRP was a breeze but this phone will not work with TWRP.

 I found these directions and got up to this point but confused from here on

 It is the time to start Magisk Manager v7.5.1 on XT2027-3 and choose Patch Boot Image File option to create the magisk_patched Boot Image File.

10. It is essential to select the stock boot img file that you have transferred to your XT2027-3.

11. It is the time to copy the magisk_patched Boot Image File from XT2027-3 to your desktop.

12. It is essential to put Motorola One Hyper (XT2027-1, XT2027-3) into fastboot mode.

13. It is the time to install magisk patched Boot Image File on XT2027-3 using the following command.

Magisk 7.5.1 on my phone has NO option to pick a boot.img file only INSTALL and that is it

I think it's worth it lol.**

Hello my fellow android users!

I am not too deep in rooting my phone or something, but I use an android. Now, I have tried an iphone, and did not like using it. the OS is just bad.. There are a lot of reasons to choose an android over an iphone, but when I try to write them.. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I can't do it.

I live in Israel (Don't Involve Politics Please...) and In Israel, if you don't have an iphone you're basically a loser.

Apple took over in the subject of phones. It drives me nuts when someone who doesn't know anything just tells someone to buy an iphone and to throw that phone in the the bin.

I am not hating on Apple but I do hate like, 90% of their users. What I find is that the people with iphones are always the basic people, sometimes I find them just less intellgient (At least in my state) Not because they are using an iphone but I feel like it says A LOT about their personality, just basic people. I also seriously find the people who use reddit in Israel (not many) to be the same kind of people who use an android.. like, it's hard to explain but that's just how it is.

Also, most of the people who use TikTok are that type of iphone people! just, less smart... idk.. I often see a video on there that shows something that I understand how it is done, or that is fake or false and no one in the comment section is getting it.. For example:

""The man who didn't eat in 40 years, and is still alive!!"" and the whole comment section is like WHATTTT how?? so cooll!!

And it's obviously not possible.. I would give many better examples but I can't think of anything right now.

And about tiktok, I do use it and I think it's a fun app, I know reddit hates tiktok but it can be really fun, the app is not bad, it's working great, and my first impression when trying it was, Ok that, that's not bad.. There are cool options, the app is smooth, works perfectly and I barely see room for improvement.

(That's if you are putting aside the crap optimization for filming with an android phone)

Oh and, to put the iphone vs android thing in perspective.. there is that kind of video with:

""ok (thumbs up) not ok (thumbs down)"" and there was one sound that girls In israel used (reacting to) and It was like, ""He is great and everything but he has bad teeth"" (like 70% of the girls made the sign of not ok)

He is great and everything but he is jealous (Most girls went with ok)

and then, ""He is great and everything but he uses a samsung"" (like 80% of the girls went with not ok)

(Not ok means not gonna want as a boyfriend)

I watched like the top 50 videos with this sound, and as I said, 80% of girls went with not ok.

This. This is the type of a personality I am talking about.

It's just like, I imagine the girl I would date in the future to be from the type of people who use an android.. I don't know how to explain it. Maybe it is just in my state, I don't really know. Maybe what iphones has become made the group of people that do use an android to like, belong to that group of people? (Which I seem to like more and want to be friends with) (Not that I hate my mom or sister who owns an iphone but you probably get what I'm saying)

Anyway, there's a dude in my class who has an iphone 11 Pro and basically acts like he a king, and he thinks there is absolutely nothing that is close to his phone in terms of, like, begin a good phone, you know. In the mind of most people today in the community in my state android=garbage (Oh and also they say iphones vs samsung, they do not know about the existence of other android phones)

I feel like I need to write a text with the benefits of an android phone over an iphone, And I truly believe there are many, but I just can't seem to ducking do it. I need to send it to him, and to know it in generel lol.

Does anybody have like a text about that? I'd love to have a link to it.

Android is great, it's better in my opinion but although I believe there are many good things to it, I can't find more than 3 words to say. I really need that for an argument, Please ? :)

744,[Help] My mum's LG Rebel 4 shr uses through Simple Mobile upon bringing it home yesterday after an outing with my sister no longer connects to the network nor shoes it has a SIM or / IMEI number which I need to talk to her provider for help. What could have happened?!,h89epk,2020-06-13 15:17:51,"Hi all!

I've never had to post here and hope I am in the right place. But I am completely lost on how to fix my mums phone after exhausting the only ways I know of solving such an issue. 

So, long ass story as short as possible. 

My mum has an LG Rebel 4 bought through Simple Mobile as a gift. Not what I would have gotten her but I have an impulsive sister I'd like to murder right now. 

Yesterday she left and the phone was working fine. I even called her on her outing to see how she was. 

Jump three hours and I call to check on her again and get her voicemail. I now assume the battery suddenly died or my moronic sibling intentionally powered off the device. 

One hour later she comes home. I said I tried to reach her multiple times but she never got any calls and the phone was ON. 

What I found wrong and tried

She has no connection to her network. No data usage what so ever. It would not even let me turn the data properly on. It says on but I have no access to APN ( which I first thought was the issue because she never updates her phone and that was what I was trying to do as it has happened to me before). No success. Also can not update at all even when connected through WiFi. 

It can no longer  receive calls or make them nor can it send texts or receive them. Just suddenly?

So I have decided to call Simple Mobile which I am about to do but they asked in the prompts for the IMEI number. When I went to the Info for her phone there is no number listed where it is supposed to show the phone number connected to the device;  it also says ""Network Unknown"" and I briefly received a message I believe saying it could not fins the SIM (It came and went quickly.)

I have not tried a factory reset because it says all data in the phone will be lost but my concern is that if I do that all info about the phone will be erased from when I entered it to set up the phone in December. 
This is also a last resort and I have never had to do it with any of my phones or devices before. I am as you can tell not well versed in this kind of tech, I am in other areas but phones have always baffled me.

If any of this makes sense to one or some of you, any advice would be greatly appreciated! 

How does this happen in the course of 4 hours?! I don't even understand it. It seems ludicrous to me. My mum is also not tech savvy and does not ""mess about"" with anything she doesn't know how to use properly first. Basically just the  browser and apps and such. 


Side note: Even as it is my mums phone my sister uses it when they are together almost daily. She deletes anything she does or tries to with little success. Could she have wiped or disconnected the phone from the network by accident?",,1,1.0

774,Ways to offer secondary verification of authenticity of an Android app,h80riv,2020-06-13 04:45:16,"I know a lot of FOSS projects publish to f-droid and that has a great system of using PGP signatures to verify the APK files.  What I'm curious about is how to verify apps deployed from the google playstore.  Now obviously PlayStore verifies the apps submitted but on more than one occasion, phishing apps that share a similar name have remained up for days.  Here are a few ways to verify the apps, that made sense to me.

1. Publish in your github repo, the full and proper playstore ID of your app
2. Publish in your github repo, the public key cert used to sign your app in playstore
3. Publish in your github repo, the full APK of your app via releases mechanism

\#1 is the simplest but isn't really cryptographically hardended.  Just makes sure the users type in the same URL you tell them to and hope there is no DNS hijack other exploits at play.

\#2 is nice since it is trivial to extract the signing cert from an installed APK and the cert fingerprint can be verified against the one in the source repo.  The signing cert never (or should never) changes so there is little maintenance this creates.  And finally, most any JDK / ADK install will be able to verify an APK against a given cert.

\#3 is probably the most complete since the user can checksum their installed APK against the one in the source repo, or simply install the one listed in the source repo.  This does put extra work on the developer since they need to remember to publish a release via github whenever they push a releast to Google.

I know it's paranoid, but there are some bitcoin Android apps that might warrant a heightened sense of paranoia.

I bought a ""new"" oneplus 7 pro from a chinese reseller.  
After opening the box I immediately understood that the phone was actually refurbished (marks showing the box was already opened, charging cable not nicely packed, with signs of previous use).  
The phone is in pristine condition so I see no real problem here.

The problems came later. The phone was already booted and waiting for me to start with the setup. I set it up, everything worked fine, until I tried to start netflix which told me the phone was not compatible. I wandered around on the internet and saw that it may mean that it has been rooted or the bootloader has been unlocked. I'm not too bad with IT but I've never rooted any of my mobile devices so it's a bit outside my domain of expertise. I also saw that GPay doesn't work on devices with bootloader unlocked so I tried to set it up and it failed.

At that point I rebooted the phone, and I saw the start-up warning that the bootloader is unlocked on this phone.

Is there a way that I can put everything back as factory-settings?  
Which means re-locking the bootloader, making sure nothing else has been tampered with, that I have the default manufacturer OS, and enjoying the full-on android experience with none of the drawbacks I mentioned?

I got a really tricky one and I've spend hours trying to figure out what to do, though nothing worked so far.

**Basic Data**: 

* Samsung Galaxy J3 (2016)
* Android 5.1.1 (Lollipop)
* Security Patch 1. November 2017

**The Problem**: The device is unable to connect to Google thus I'm unable to access the PlayStore. This is necessary since Whatsapp refuses to work until I update it to a more recent version.

Also Ive pulled some Updates and they went through flawlessly, but the phone stayed on 5.1 (saying its all up-to-date), eventhough the Internet says the J3 is upgradable to 7.1

**What I tried**: First I was thinking about readding the Google account, so I focused on that part. I restarted the device, cleared the cache of PlayStore, GooglePlayServices (GPS) and Download-Manager. Since that wasn't working I deactivated the GPS and uninstalled all updates of it reseting it to the factory version in the process. Normally this is fine as there isn't any crucial data stored in the GPS-Data. But then things got really weird. When I activated it again I recieved permanent crash-notifications of GPS. Re-Adding the Google-Account was also impossible as it just stayed at the first ""please Wait""-Screen while spamming the crash-notifications.

At that point I decided its no use and would be easier to just backup all data and reset the phone. Even more so as there really isn't much data on the phone. Just Contacts, Pics and Whatsapp.

Backing up Pics and Contacts is easy enough, but I can't get a backup of whatsapp. I managed to access whatsapp by disabling all outgoing connections and turning back the date to a date where it was still working. Once inside I turned to settings>Chat>Chat Backup and hit ""Backup Now"". A few seconds later it said it wasn't able to backup the chats to drive (which is expected and perfectly fine, since I just want a local Backup). The time of the last backup also got adjusted to the current time. When I checked the local storage under Whatsapp\\Backups i just hat two backups called something with settings and something with stickers, both with less than 1MB, so definetly not the chats. While looking for the Chats I found something in Whatsapp\\Databases. There was a file called msgstore.something, however it had just 6MB. Way to small to contain all chats including all media.

So I was thinking, is there some way to pull a backup using for example adb or another feature of whatsapp or Android, or is all this data lost? Also can I assume the problem to be solved once I reset the phone or can I expect the error to persist?",,1,1.0

This post will help you to deal with this problem 


1. Download [App Inspector ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bg.projectoria.appinspector) app from playstore and locate the apps which you want to remove. Tap on it and you will see the package name of that app. Note down the package name somewhere on a paper. You will need it later on.

2. Download Platform tools and ADB Drivers of your phone on pc.
     i) :- [Plat form tools ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11hBMnPhiaSXLDwpsJ2xgW3msevj2Dqpr/view?usp=drivesdk)

     ii) [Universal ADB Drivers ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11dTgIS1Ys_uB0DmsTq27dvMaIKFaaepn/view?usp=drivesdk)

3. Enable USB Debugging on your phone. 

4. Connect your phone to your pc via a USB cable and locate ADB Driver folder which you downloaded earlier and run Universal ADB Driver app. It will automatically detect your phone. Now install USB Drivers. 

5. Now go to platform tools folder and open command prompt window here. 

6. Now enter the following commands and after each command press Enter. 
   i) adb devices 
   ii) adb shell
   iii) pm uninstall -k --user 0 name of package

Note :- replace ' name of package' with the package name which you have noted at the 1st step. 

7. By now you would have able to remove the system apps. 

8. If you still have some confusion you can watch my YouTube video on it. Hope this information helps you.

943,Sync notifications between devices?,h0clj7,2020-06-10 14:53:23,"I have an old Nexus 9 tablet I still use from time to time, but one of the reasons I use it less often is the number of notifications I have to swipe away because I've already looked at them on my phone. One of the worst offenders is the official Reddit app, but it's not the only one. I get notifications on both but usually address them from my phone. But the amount of notifications I get between using my tablet is annoying, to say the least.

I know I can completely disable the notifications, but I kind of still want them. What I'd rather have is... well, when a notification is addressed on one device, it's cleared on the other automatically. It doesn't have to be immediate, but perhaps the ""sync"" occurs when I wake up the tablet again?

The G5 has no network issues. The G7 has chronic messaging issues. The only app we're using for messaging is the default Messages app from Google. MMS messages often take 5-15 minutes to send, or won't send at all until we turn off wifi. SMS messages sometimes won't send either. When I say they won't send, they say ""sending"" for a long time, then say it failed. Sometime the only way to send multiple SMS messages in a row is to restart the phone between each message. It is frustratingly erratic, so we haven't been able to isolate conditions that consistently replicate the problem, but it happens often.

Our carrier confirms that the settings are correct. The SIM card is pretty old and has some slight signs of wear, but they charge to replace it (ugh), so we haven't tried that yet. (If taking the phone off wifi sometimes fixes the problem, does that mean it's not the SIM card?) Moto is still updating Android for the G7, and the phone itself is fully updated. The phone was bought direct from Motorola and is out of warranty, so we'd have to go through their customer service if we decide it's the device.

985,Customising Gboard on Android vs iOS,gzq8os,2020-06-09 16:15:58,"Customising Gboard on Android I ran into a [post](https://9to5google.com/2019/03/28/gboard-2-ios-theming/) from Mar 2019 about being able to customise Gboard 2.0 on iOS.   Apparently you could choose any colour for individual keys, border colour individually, the trail colour for glide typing.  
Was this ever something that Android Gboard got/had? Or did we have it and then it went away?",,3,1.0
986,Finding a way to mirror your phone on a computer,gzpt2z,2020-06-09 15:54:09,"Hello guys.

A bit ago my screen died on me. I was watching a video and the screen went black, but the sound was still going. It still does not turn on, but the phone seems to be working since alarms still go off.
I can send it back for reparations since it is still under guarantee. But they say that they will wipe offf the data of the phone.

Thus, I'd like to find a way to mirror my phone screen on a computer, so that I can back up my data.

I know that there are apps for that, but I can't install them without seeing the screen (or can I ?).

So, is it possible ?

987,OnePlus 8 Pro Display issues,gzpl3u,2020-06-09 15:42:25,"So i got myself a OnePlus 8 Pro couple of days ago. 2 days ago i spotted it had a image retention issues and went to replace it. replacement had the same issue regarding retention. it has green tint to it and a black crushes too but latest update fixed it ever so slightly but that is not worrying me at all. but i am worried about the retention, since i don't want a burn in. it's a reseller shop so they said it might be a software issue and asked me to wait for new batch to come in and compare it if newer ones are going to have the same issue they are going to replace it with another phone or give me a replacement with a totally different phone.i honestly don't know what to do. i love this phone and for a different phone S20 here has the exynos chip which is awful + there are no other alternatives. Can you suggest me what to do?P.S OP subreddit is flagging this post for some reason and i came here if i won't get a boot ofc :D",,1,1.0
988,Format SSD card to internal storage,gzpfk1,2020-06-09 15:34:34,"Hi,

I would like some help to format my ssd card to internal storage for my Huawei P8 Lite 2017.

To begin, this device doesn't have the native option to consider external storages as internal.   
Thus, I did the following things :

* Uninstall my phone drivers
* Install universal android drivers
* Plug my phone by USB and permit transfer
* Permit USB Debug mode

I then tried two different solutions that both failed. 

# The first solution I tried is using ""aftiss.cmd"" from [this forum](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software/auto-formatting-sdcard-to-internal-t3583875).

The following code appeared :

    Auto-formatting SDCard to Internal and SDCard storage
    
    - Start ADB Server...
    - Connect to device...
    - Device: PRA-LX1
    - Formatting disk:179:192...
    Error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: command '69 volume partition disk:179:192 mixed 25' failed with '400 69 Command failed'
    - Kill ADB Server...
    
    - Done =) -

# The second solution was using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). 

It failed to set force adoptable to true :

    * daemon started successfully
    HWPRA-H:/ $ sm list-disks
    disk:179:192
    HWPRA-H:/ $ sm set-force-adoptable true
    Error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Adoptable storage not available on device with native FBE

And failed again to format the SD card :

    1|HWPRA-H:/ $ sm partition disk:179:192 mixed 75
    Error: java.lang.IllegalStateException: command '70 volume partition disk:179:192 mixed 75' failed with '400 70 Command failed'

# I'm out of solution here. Can you help me to solve my problem please ?

By the way, the reason I want to do this is because I can only install apps on internal storage and my phone only got 16Gb of it. For information, my SD card is 128Gb from SanDisk.

989,"Downloaded a file, how do I select which app it opens with?",gzpbv9,2020-06-09 15:29:20,"I have a lighting app that I download different files for.  The files are a unique type, and my phone won't open them with the proper app.  I know it's not a file or app issue, my phone just doesn't want to open the file with the correct app.

Is there a way I can select specifically which app to open this unique file type if I download it? Thank you.",,1,1.0
