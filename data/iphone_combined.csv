My story sounds like this: since everybody knows, electronics/devices in USA are cheaper and(as far as I know) better quality, I bought 2 iPhone 11 from west coast of US via a friend of mine in december 2019. I gave the money to this friend, he delivered me the 2 phones and after this he told me that I need to wait a few months in order to activate them because he didnt’t paid them full or something like this.

Now I am asking you guys because you know better, especially the ones living in the US, is it mandatory to send the phones back just to be activated?

Here are the things I tried: blowing air into the speaker, shaking it a little bit (It may be dumb but you never know), [apple’s recommendations](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203794), water eject although it hadn’t been anywhere near water (that reminds me I had resorted to this around 2 months ago, some water had gotten into one of the speakers, or maybe both, but I eventually got it out (which again reminds me, I think around that same time I experienced something similar, only then I was on Instagram, got the phone to my ear to listen to an audio, and it was stuck on outputting from the earpiece, it worked fine after a simple reboot) I don’t know if any of this is relevant), making a call on speaker works but only through the top speaker, plugging and unplugging headphones, on and off Bluetooth, rebooting, reset settings, and only then did I remember hard reboot was an option, and since it still didn’t work, I tried it too. Finally I tried cleaning up the lightning port and the speaker grill with a sharpened q-tip, although there wasn’t much to clean.

I think the next step is to factory reset, but I’d like to see if there’s anything else I can do.

I saw a video somewhere where they had a similar issue and fixed it by deleting an app that “controls the speakers”, I haven’t installed any new app, is there a way to see which apps do that?, but I guess if that was the case resetting settings should’ve solved it?

Could you help me figure out what could’ve happened? I didn’t really drop it that day (yesterday, this happened ~18h ago), didn’t get no shock or any particular damage.

Apple has to have some feature for it, I mean I have my apple id password and even know the passcode! What more do they want to verify that it was my phone? 😖. That would enable them to reset your device.  They’ll never do data recovery.

Why didn’t you have these ‘very important’ photos backed up?

What if it had been stolen rather than disabled?. If this were possible you could steal a phone and get the data off it.   Which would t be good, right?. That was very stupid of me! I should've had done a backup but I am so f-in careless! 😐️ 
My ipod was stolen too and I hadn't backed up its data also. However I didn't learn anything from that experience 🤦‍♂️ I couldn't care less at that time.

But the photos I had in this phone were extremely valuable to me. I guess I'll keep the phone like this forever, better than losing it completely.
At least I'll have a feeling that the photos are still in the phone 😭",410.0,16,157,0

According to her, she was trying to change her passcode from her old 6 digit code to a 7 digit one. After that she decides to change it back to the original 6 digit code. Apparently, while the code was verifying for quite a while, my other sibling suggests to them that they should turn the iPhone off (not shut it down completely). Now while this appears to work, the phone says it requires a 6 digit code or touch ID, but when we try to unlock the phone with the original 6 digits, it doesn't work. This of course sends the into a panic and is when I arrived home is when they tell me all this. Is there any way this can be solved without reseting the phone or is all hope lost?

- Dropped it a day or two ago and won't turn back on, usually when this happened I could fix it by charging it and it will force to turn on. What happened when I did that was it shows the Apple logo and it would turn off again and stuck in that loop.

- Took it for repair and learned that the battery was ok and the phone most likely needed a factory reset, took them an hour to no avail but assured that it could be fixed though I took the phone anyway and went home.

- Tried iTunes and Fonepaw, usually when the recovery is about the start, the phone restarts (when in recovery mode) and then the Apple logo with the loading will show up (based on videos I've watched). This doesn't happened on me and it would just go back to recovery mode and iTunes and Fonepaw would show me error.

Apple has (deliberately) made it hard/impossible to retrieve data without the cooperation of the installed/authorised iOS.. Likely not, but worth a try.. Just saying the phone is fried everything is gone. The data is like irretrievable, the hardware probably isn’t ‘fried’ though.

OP needs to learn how to make and maintain backups.. I been through this for years. Once the device runs out of storage you have to erase the device. Everything is gone . You can try soldering people but can’t find anyone. Sigh... that’s not ‘fried’.

Fried is hardware failure, to the point of being bricked.

In OP’s case DFU restore will likely result in a working device.. Doesn’t always work. You will either get 4013 or 43 can’t remember but vye. Never had one fail a DFU without hardware issues.

How did you transfer the video from your dash cam to your iPhone initially?

&nbsp;

If there is a wired (or wireless) connection between your phone and the camera, and the video is still stored locally on your dash cam, it’s conceivable that’s how the video reappears.

&nbsp;

In addition, if there is a cloud service to which your cam connects, such as Dropbox, it may have read/write access to your photos on iOS. I am unsure if cloud services (other than iCloud) currently have the ability to push photos and videos to your iOS Photos Camera Roll, but it’s worth mentioning.. It’s turned off and I even cleared iCloud of everything except contacts.. I used a memory card adapter to plug the memory card into my phone. Then used the “files” app to download the video to my Photos app.. Doesn’t sound like that would be the culprit, then. If you turned off all the iCloud syncing options except for contacts as you stated, including iCloud Drive, it’s possible the video gets transferred back if you sync your phone to iTunes or the Mac Photos app via cable or Wi-Fi somehow. That assumes the video is on your other device and it detects the video is “missing” on your phone, resulting in its restoration.

&nbsp;

Apple Support could probably help you if none of that seems likely, since they’re the experts. You can call them on the phone or use a form on the Apple website and someone will email you back with a reply. For this, I’d suggest a phone call.",264.0,7,67,0

With the iPhone oriented sideways so that the side button is on top, press the button repeatedly through the paper towel while allowing water to squeeze out to wash out the button area. This should be far safer than just putting the button under running water or putting the button just barely under standing water and pressing it.

iPhone 7 is the first iPhone to have water resistance, so this should be safe. However, it's your choice whether you do this, so if any water damage occurs, I will not be held responsible. I'm just telling you what you can do because I believe there's no other way unless you want to take it to an Apple store and have them clean it. That could be expensive.

It definitely has battery problems although I couldn't tell you what is considered severe or not. It started by losing a pretty good amount of battery charge overnight so I began to charge it overnight which I know is a bad thing for the battery and might explain a bit here but I never thought it'd get this bad. At least I'm assuming that's where my issue stems from. Anyway I've become accustomed to it dying anywhere from 1% - 50% now. So when I woke up this morning and saw it was on 10% I immediately went downstairs to charge it (my charger was plugged into my pc which I'm currently using to post) and of course, by the time I plugged it in it was already dead. But now it shows the apple sign signaling its powering on, then the lock screen and before I can make any inputs it dies again then immediately powers on. I effectively cant interact with it.

50,"Lost a ton of iCloud data years ago and have been trying to restore what I can. I found a video I’ve been looking for in my old texts, but it just shows a file name, I can’t click or open it. More info below",hax1gf,2020-06-17 18:26:40,"[image of issue](https://imgur.com/gallery/wygLdJB)

I made a post about this issue yesterday, and while there’s no way to retrieve the data from my broken phone, and Apple support couldn’t retrieve my old iCloud data, I was wondering if anyone here knows how I can get this file opened. 

All videos and texts in my messages from before my iCloud mishap won’t show in texts anymore. iCloud randomly didn’t save a good portion of a backup from a few years ago. 

TL;DR: Just wondering if there’s any way to open this video file I linked. When I click on it, it just gives me the options to “react” to it. Nothing else.",1,1.0,7.0,"I think you need to be able to see the file hierarchy of your text messages in the device files.. if you can locate this .mp4 in the root of the phone - if you can do that you can transfer it to your computer and see if its corrupted or the file size could be like 0bytes or maybe it opens on pc with the right program, if its corrupted but still size to the file you can pay someone to analyze it and recover whats possible if anything, but this is usually not a free service.. Unfortunately the phone the file was originally sent to is destroyed, and that particular iCloud backup failed (mostly, only saved the last ~10% of the backup for some reason).

On my current phone, when I look at the message it was sent to me on, the file appears but it can’t be interacted with. I think the only way I can get the data from the destroyed phone would be to repair it somehow.. Maybe try sending the file to your email from the working phone that youre trying to view the file on now, then opening it on your computer for further diagnostic.. Won’t let me interact with the file, though now instead of the image it shows in the link, after some fucking around it shows “downloading 0/2.6 MB”, but won’t go any further than that.. Screenshots are best - probably wont be able to recover though. Ive taken many technical losses like this.. [update compared to original link ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Gcs5AmB)


I deleted tons of space, exited and re-entered my my Apple ID, added more space to my iCloud, backed everything up again, etc. don’t really know where to go from here, but now I can see the file size, though I still can’t interact with it or upload it to my computer (including emailing it to myself, the forward button is greyed out).

54,What's the appeal of wireless charging for iPhones?,hau790,2020-06-17 16:09:59,"I have an iPhone XS and I recently picked up an Anker Powerwave pad to try out wireless charging.  So far, I'm not sure I totally understand the appeal of it.

Wireless charging:
- is slower than a high amperage lightning connection (USB Power Delivery)
- requires a more precise positioning than a wired connection (several times I've woken up in the morning with an uncharged phone, having accidentally nudged it off the pad in my sleep)
- prevents the use of other useful rear-mounted phone accessories like magnet car mounts and Pop Sockets
- doesn't continue to charge while you are using the phone (since you've lifted it up from the charging pad)

The only upsides that I can see is that you reduce the daily wear & tear on the lighting port, and that placing it on a pad is somewhat faster and more convenient than reaching for a cable and plugging it in.

I'd love to embrace a wonderful future without wires, but I don't really see the upsides right now.  Am I missing something?",13,0.94,14.0,"It’s convenient to charge the device overnight by throwing it into your wireless charging pad, without the need to fiddle about with cables. 

It’s true that it prevents use of accessories that clamp into the back, but for those of us that don’t like those accessories this is a non-issue. 

Also you can get chargers with different angles so you can use the device while it’s charging.. My use case: when I’m at work I can toss it down on my desk on a charging pad, and when I get called somewhere I can just grab and go. I can keep the cable going to the pad tucked away to help keep my desk a little more tidy.. I find the fact that you can’t use it an advantage cause it stops me scrolling through reddit when I get into bed and I usually sleep better when that happens. Plugging requires fine motor skill.  When you’re tired you have zero motivation to put in the effort to wake up your brain to put in the work to apply fine motor skills.  Solution is the wireless charging pad.  Zzzzzzzzz. I have three in my room, I can just drop my phone on one to charge, pick it up easily, no cables to deal with, especially in the dark, I just drop it on the pad, a weird hand motion to align it if I'm not looking and boom.

It's a really subjective thing. Some like me, think it's the coolest thing but a lot of people don't really care.. I use Samsung Wireless Charger, with a fast charge option to charge my iPhone XS Max. So far, so good. And it's pretty fast, much quicker than lightning cable port. It's convenient for use, I just put my phone and go to sleep.   


As far as a battery health concerns, I think It doesn't affect it that much.. I have a car mount that is also a wireless charger. That’s pretty cool.. Samsung, Anker, and MyCharge produce portable wireless chargers (they are portable charging banks that double as a wireless charger) which allows you to use your phone while it's wireless charging. I use a [myCharge 10,000 mAh](https://www.amazon.com/myCharge-Wireless-Portable-10000mAh-Certified/dp/B07CP3JSKL/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=mycharge+portable+wireless+charger&qid=1592424310&sr=8-3) whenever I was traveling and at an airport since it allowed me to play on my phone, text, and make calls while it was charging.. I have a wireless charging stand. I keep my phone on it while working. That way it’s keeping a charge but I don’t have to mess with wires when I get a text or want to check something on it. I wouldn’t use it as the only charger myself though.. My last two iPhones have had their USB ports die on me and I could no longer charge them. That’s why I went for one with wireless charging.. I've only used the cradle kind of wireless charger, I have two generic Target store brand chargers (they were on clearance). It works really well with the that style of charger, easy to set it down in the right position. and phone is upright, easy to pick up.  Maybe try the cradle type of design.

I was skeptical of the wireless charging, but kind of wish all my electronics had it now. I still use the lightning cable to charge it when wireless isn't convenient.. Slower the charge, prelong your battery health. Good idea use wireless bedtime and cable during day.. I don't know, it's just cooler to put your phone on a wireless charging pad. Also more convenient.. Maybe it's the type of pad I'm using, but I find that I need WAY MORE motor finesse with the pad. I can plug a lighting cable into my phone in the dark, with my eyes closed.

With the pad, I have to make sure the phone is properly centred, that the LED on the pad turns on (to indicate the connection is good) and/or to feel the brief vibration from the phone telling me that power is connected. 

Last night I was SO sure I had set the phone down properly to charge. This morning I wake up to a 20% uncharged battery. Ugh.",696.0,8,173,0

To enable that, you will go to Settings > your name > iCloud > Photos and change from ""Download and Keep Originals"" to ""Optimize iPhone Storage""..

Welp, this may have wrecked your chances for deleting your data.

[Try going here](https://www.icloud.com/find). Login with your Apple ID, and see if the site can track the location of your phone.  If you're lucky, you might even be able to find out where it is and recover it!

Unfortunately, this requires that your phone be on and have a data connection. If you called your provider and had them block the phone, then it's no longer on the cellular network and won't get data that way.. Only if the phone has auto-connected to WiFi (or the person taking it has connected to a WiFi network or inserted a new SIM) will it show up here.

That site also gives you the option to wipe your phone remotely, but this also requires an active network connection.  Note that if you wipe the data from your phone remotely, you will no longer be able to track its location.

Next time you lose your phone, follow steps in this order:

* Login, track your phone, lock it down with a passcode and a ""contact me"" message
* If you can't locate or physically recover it, *then* do a remote data wipe
* *Then* contact your provider to block the device.

Note: If you had a passcode on your iPhone, then the data on it is encrypted. Whoever has your phone would need the passcode to unlock your device and get data off it.. So when i press on the “erase device” button then it may or may not delete the content depending on if the person who took it connects to the internet. But if i do erase the device will it also delete all my icloud data as well from my other devices?. Thank you all for the help and also helping me not to freak out as much. Already got a new one because of the insurance i had on it. i was only worried about my data being misused.. If the phone is connected to the internet, it will receive the remote erase command and everything will be deleted from the phone.  This will NOT erase any of your data from iCloud or other devices using the same Apple ID.

Did you have the phone set to require a passcode (or Touch/Face ID) to unlock the phone screen?  If you did, nobody else will be able to access the data on your phone unless they know your unlock passcode.. Yes i did have passcode and Face ID but I am worried that there may be a way to bypass all of them and still get into the phone.. They only way to access the phone without the passcode is to put it in recovery mode and restore to factory settings using a computer.  That, of course, will delete everything from the phone including any of your personal data.. There is no way to do that chances are it will be parted out",550.0,16,57,0

If you want take advance backup and see those photos. Pay version call Copytrans.net, they have a bundle of softwares which straight forward and very useful.

Has it suffered any drops or water damage?

It is more likely that the battery needs to be replaced.

There is a PC application called 3utools which you can use to see how many cycles the battery has been through. iPhone batteries last about 500 cycles (One charge cycle is the battery discharge from 100% to 0%), so if your phone is showing 400+ cycles, then it is worth considering replacing the battery. 

FYI - If you discharge the battery to 50% and charge it up. Discharge it to 50% and charge it up, then that is one charge cycle.

As the battery ages from time and discharge cycles, it will become less efficient. By about 500 cycles, the battery would show approximately 80% capacity. For example - a new iPhone 6 capacity is 1810mAh, after 500 cycles, it would have about 1448mAh (80%). This will show up as ""100%"".

However, this may not diagnose any other faults or issues with the device.. I agree that the battery likely needs to be replaced if the issue continues using an Apple-certified charging cable.. I bought it 2 years ago and it has not suffered from either of those. Yeah it prob has something to do with the battery and ill def check out that website tysm",216.0,6,130,0

Unfortunately, I don’t think there is a way to tell directly on the iPhone other than giving them different names. However, if you go into your routers settings, you can generally see how devices are connected (2.4 GHz, 5GHz or Wired.) You can also rename your 2.4 and 5GHz networks here as well. I usually give them different names since I live in an apartment, and there are usually over 20 networks in range that cause interference. Since 5GHz has a shorter range (which isn’t a concern in an apartment), this means that there is generally less interference from your neighbors networks.. Unfortunately I don't control my network, my landlord does. So I can't personally rename them to make the distinction and I'm certain my landlord wouldn't be willing to go through that trouble for me.. I’m not sure then...

Did you try turning the volume up while on the call?
Does this happen only on phone calls? Do you have the same behavior during FaceTime audio calls or Facebook Messenger audio calls?

Deeper stuff check:

Are you up to date with iOS 13.5.1? Have you tried restarting your iPhone?

Are your other notification sounds playing normally?

Is the sound issue only while your iPhone is directly against your head? If you pull your iPhone away from your head (to the point the display comes back on) does the volume increase?

Trying to help narrow down the issue as the wait time for Apple Support (in the Americas) is running about 30 minutes at this time.. I made sure the volume was all the way up on a call. I just tried FaceTime audio call and it was low as well. I tried pulling my phone away from my face and nothing. 

I have restart my phone, I have reset it. All notifications work. I am up to date on 13.5.1.. When you say that you reset it...did you Erase All Content and Settings or just Reset All Settings?

This is a little bit of a long shot:

Turn off Attention Aware. Attention Aware will adjust volumes based on if the iPhone detects if you are actively using it or not. It should only adjust ringer and notification volumes, but it may be interfering with your call volume as well.

You go into Settings > Accessibility > Face ID & Attention > Attention Aware Features.. I did reset all settings. And I just turned off the attention aware features, no change.. Might want to reach out to Apple Support then. Let them know what you’ve already tried and they will let you know what to do from there.

Just be forewarned, as I mentioned before, wait times have been between 20-30 minutes. Also, if you do need to have your iPhone serviced, the options are limited right now, but they will let you know what is available.

Also, don’t try walking in to an Apple Store as they will turn you away. They are by appointment only for service issues right now.. Okay, I’ll contact them. I was thinking of going to the Verizon store that I bought it from... should I not do that?. They will probably refer you back to Apple since it may be a warranty issue..

This is my daughter's phone so it's hard to know for sure when it started or why..

She also mentioned something about a number she didn't recognize when she tried to reset her password for iCloud.

I have tried pretty much everything I found on the internet..

* Reset Network Settings
* Reboot iPhone
* Disabled iMessage, FaceTime, signed out of iCloud, waited over night, signed in to iCloud, tried to activate iMessage and it failed.
* Erased phone and restored from backup
* Tried just on LTE, just on WIFI
* Reseated the SIM card

Update us if you happen to resolve this please, it helps make the forum more useful and it’s cool to learn how. In order for iMessage to activate for the telephone number, a silent SMS has to be sent through the carrier.  To test that functionality, go to Settings > Messages, turn iMessage off.   Then, open the Messages app and try sending a text to her own number.  You need to be sure it shows twice (sent & received).

If that is successful, contact Apple Support.  They can check to see if her telephone number has an iMessage or FaceTime block.  That can happen sometimes if someone reports a message as being spam, for example.",184.0,6,308,0

I’m guessing that my X is completely toast & I have it set to backup to iCloud but I can’t really figure out how to tell when the last update was? I’m assuming everything that I did on my phone today is gone (including the photos from the first time my baby went swimming which I’m now an emotional mother about) but how can I tell when my last back up actually was? 

Face ID stopped working about maybe a year or so ago, I attributed that to my having dropped the phone quite a lot (thank god for a strong case!) and knocked something out of whack. I’m guessing when it got wet this time it just ruined something and it doesn’t want to work now.

I haven’t tried anything other than hard restarting the phone twice (put it in a bag of rice now, but the phone actually seems to be turning on if the apple is showing up??) and plugging it into my laptop but that’s all. I’m open to any information about how to possibly get the phone restored so I can continue use, or how to pull any pictures from today off of it possibly. I guess I’ll finally start uploading my photos to the cloud - this is what I get for not doing it! 

Thank you so much for any help in advance.",9,1.0,13.0,"I was about to say use iCloud to get everything off of it but in the end I read you don’t use iCloud. 

My recommendation is to store it in a dry place, stop charging it, and don’t try to start it for at least a week or two. Then try starting it again.. Never put a iPhone in rice!!. Try this: take your phone apart and disconnect your battery. Then, make sure there is no water in there. Do not use rice but use silica gel in a sealed plastic bag. Then, disconnect the earpiece assembly and leave it disconnected and try turning the phone on. 

These two are to ensure that the logicboard isn’t fried as well as making sure that restore error isn’t caused by a bad earpiece assembly. Hope it helps a bit. Well, I back up my phone to the cloud, but not my photos as I take them so they aren’t accessible from my iPad. Pretty annoyed with myself, honestly!. Oops!. ..umm! Haha! I don’t know; that definitely sounds difficult??. Photos are, by default, also part of iCloud Backups, it’s just that those backups occur less frequently than just straight up syncing them with iCloud Photos. You’ll most likely have all of your photos as of a day or two before your phone got fried. If you don’t want to use iCloud, you can also download Google Photos in the future, which is a great alternative with free unlimited online space.

When you set up your new iPhone, select the “Restore from iCloud Backup” option and you’ll see a list of backups made in the past couple of weeks, with their respective dates listed as well. You can also see when your last automatic backup was on another iOS device if you are signed into the same iCloud account as your old phone was. On your, eg. iPad, go into Settings then tap on your name at the top. Then scroll down and select your old iPhone from the list. Under “iCloud Backup” you’ll see when the last backup was made. Hope that helped, and good luck!. Check dm.  Dm I can do it for you. Yeah I would definitely not do what he said if none of it sounds familiar.. Don’t have anything!. Yeah absolutely not, I don’t even have equipment for that and I’m absolutely NOT good with technology, let alone repairs. Maybe some day, but today is not that day!. I messaged you",412.0,19,412,0

It's an iPhone X that was running 13.5",1,1.0,10.0,"Backups form an older version will o onto a new version (otherwise restoring backups onto new iPhones would be a lot more trouble).  Backups from a new iOS version onto an older one are where you run into trouble.

If you have a good backup, I would DFU restore to stock (13.5.1), then restore the backup onto it.. For future reference. If you have tons of Other after deleting something, sync it with iTunes or try leaving charging overnight so it could index data. And ofc keep around 5-10% free in any case.... It worked  :D I called apple support to ask the question cause I was impatient and went through with it. Thanks! Ill leave it up for anyone else who might find this. Also buying an external tonight to backup my laptop to now because im traumatized and should've been backing it up already anyway. I did that. I had synced with iTunes multiple times. Other got bigger over the course of a few days so it was definitely charging overnight multiple days. Started at 10gb when I was 'full'. then at the end of that day it was 13gb. Next day it was at like 15 or 16gb. Then finally 18gb. I didnt specify the time frame differences in my op. 

When I finally restored from backup after a fresh wipe and update, my Other was 5gb< and I had 47gb used instead of 63.9gb.. Good to hear.

‘There are to types of people in the world, those that backup, and those who haven’t lost data *yet*’ 😉. Have you tried reinstalling Facebook/Spotify/Netflix btw? They are known cache abusers, along with other apps that save local version of the media that you watch.. I didnt try reinstalling those, but the data under those apps were all under 1gb, so I imagined they were not bulked up. Unless their data does not list under their app listing in the iPhone storage menu, they were not the culprit. if the documents and data from those apps do not list under their app listing where it shows that apps data usage, then they could've been a culprit. can't find out now though.. Other is a pandemic \*\*\* now, so still better to check this next time. From what I know cache won't be listed under app data usage and goes straight to Other, so yeah it could be the case.

Hope you won't need this info though, situation is damn frustrating.. yeah no ill definitely keep it in mind for next time. I troubleshot damn near everything I could find before resorting to restoring. thank ya. Np.",436.0,13,202,0

When A texts B, it looks like the text is going through fine from the point of view of A, and if A tries to call B, it goes straight to voicemail. 


I tried walking A through checking to see if B is blocked, and the B is not blocked on their phone, nor on their Verizon account. 


Does the text and voicemail situation indicate B could have their number blocked by mistake? We've all talked about it and B says it isn't the case, nor would it be intended.


Could it be a bug of some kind? Any search results point to a blocked contact, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on here. I could walk A through a factory reset and logging back in, but don't want to do that if it isn't necessary or wouldn't possibly make a difference (geography of all three of us being apart and technological literacy). 


Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1,1.0,9.0,"Is the contact in the phone of who’s not getting the calls. I know there’s a setting on iPhone to redirect unknown calls to voice mail without making the phone ring. Then text messages should go through tho.

Seems like you checked the blocked numbers on the phone and on the phone provider website. 

Call Verizon and see how to update the profile on their network. Reset phone. 

Other then that I don’t know why the person is getting redirected or not receiving phones. Maybe it’s the provider of one of the phones as you said people are pretty far apart. Maybe they got some weird restrictions going on. 

Hope you figure it out. Let us know.. It does sound like contact b does have that phone number blocked tho. 🤷🏼‍♂️. Yea it’s super weird. Umm did B ever had a android before getting a I phone and used the same SIM card??
Is the text messages going to B green? Or blue?

Green means it thinks B is a non iPhone. If blue it knows it’s a iPhone. I phones don’t send SMS to another iPhones anymore they use MMS encryption service. It sends SMS to a non iPhone and it displays a green bubble. Maybe it’s that. Try to delete both contacts on both phones and create new contacts and try again. 

Go to settings. Go to messages on both phones and make sure the iMessage is on.  Turn on the sms also if iMessages isn’t available at any time. iPhones will try to send it in MMS but will eventually send it in SMS if needed to.

This is what mine looks like. 

Let me know if any of that works.. Any update??. Thanks for the replies - will look into that first and then try the other avenues. I appreciate the feedback.. Apparently contact B is still getting messages from A - would that happen if A is blocked on B's phone?. Phone B tried everything to update settings, delete and add A as a contact, etc. with no luck. Still have to circle back with A and check everything there.. If A (IPhone) is sending messages to B (iPhone) and B can see them then no A is not blocked on B phone. 

So the only problem is A calls B and B doesn’t get a ring and the call goes right to voice mail. Sounds like B doesn’t have A contact in his phone. And his iPhone has the silence unknown caller on his phone. 

Look in settings- phone - and under call silences
 Right above the block list. 

I believe if caller A calls B a few times right after the other. Caller B phone will finally ring as it thinks it’s a emergency. 

Here’s a article on it. From Apple. 

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207099

If that doesn’t work I don’t know what caller B is doing with his phone. I’m sure it’s his phone that’s causing the problem. Is caller (B) a iPhone?. B is also an iPhone, yes.  

You're correct that A calls B and B doesn’t get a ring and the call goes right to voice mail.

A can text B. But when B texts A, A does not ever get the message.

I'll try to have B check what you mentioned about unknown callers, and maybe delete A as a contact and re-add. Any other ideas appreciated.  Thanks so much for your help so far!",595.0,14,186,0
131,Can I Hide or Block the Voice Memos app?,h8aboi,2020-06-13 16:10:29,"Our young daughter has voice memos on her iPad and she is over the top obsessed with yelling and screaming at it to see how the bars change with her voice. At first, it was cute how interested she was in seeing how her voice changes the sound waves, but now it’s our least favorite thing. We let her use her iPad twice a day- in the early morning when she gets up before us, and for an hour during the day for “quiet rest time.”  (Yes, she has other toys and things to do... she mostly uses it to play a couple little SagoMini games... parental controls are on...) We have told her to stop yelling at it, and she will... until she remembers she has the app and starts doing it again. 

It’s gotten to the point where she uses it so much that not only is it driving us insane, her “memos” are taking up all the space on her iPad.  She has well over 1000 recordings and sometimes just doesn’t hit the end recording button so she’ll have 7 hours of just random talking throughout the day.

We don’t mind if she uses it for 10-15 minutes but just not for an whole freakin’ hour. I would love to just be able to put a parental control on that app.. Mentioned above- I have tried to find an option to set screen time specifically for that app and I can't locate it anywhere. Does it exist for apps individually (and could you direct me) or do you need to just set the screen time across the board? We want her to have access to her iPad to play her other games, just not this particular one as often as she is using it.. Screen time. Set limits on it. Test with setting it for Other category, no way to set specific apps from what I've just tested (voice memos app is Utility). Another idea is to delete the app and set a block for AppStore so it can't be redownloaded without your permission. Would be much less hassle to re-install it twice a day if needed.

>Rice is the homeopathy of mobile repair or as r/MobileRepair calls it Holistic Phone Repair.. Rice does nothing, please don’t recommend it. Also it’s water damaged, Apple will take one look at the water damage indicators and decline the repair.. I would highly recommend at least cleaning out the charging port with isopropyl alcohol before attempting to charge the device. Powering on the phone with any moisture can potentially short out and/or corrode the components. As below, your device started working again because the water began to evaporate. The damage has been done unfortunately and it's only a matter of time until it stops working again.

I'd recommend you take it to a repair company so they can clean it (most that do board repairs will have an ultrasonic cleaner that they can use to remove most of the corrosion on the surface).. Is it working?. I wish I could tell you something more helpful. With earlier phones that had removable batteries you could put the parts in rice individually and accelerate the drying time. Now you just have to leave it and pray all the moisture gets out of everywhere before using it again, or at least before pushing physical buttons.. i mean leaving it in rice overnight worked for me, but thank you for the advice. The corrosion started the instant water got inside it unfortunately. OP needs to have their device professionally looked at and cleaned if they want it to stand the best chance of not suddenly failing.. yeah it is actually, i think it may be because my iphone is water resistant + i pulled it out a couple seconds after it fell in. yeah after i left it in overnight everything turned out fine but thank you for replying!!. Rice really does nothing, it does not pull the moisture away from your device. As soon as you've got water in it the damage is done- corrosion is a chemical reaction and starts immediately.

The reason it has become a myth is because people leave their devices in rice for a few days and suddenly it works again, when the reality is simply that the water has evaporated from the internals.

As above once a device is water damaged, it will never be the same again. It might work for a few days, few months, a year etc. but it will always fail at some point due to the water.

Who is your wireless carrier, pre paid or post paid?. Does your carrier throttle if you go over your allowance?. I have unlimited data. I don’t have a limit.

I thought maybe it was because of the latest iOS update.

Does anyone know how long it can stay in water?,1,0.67,6.0,"Some 5 6 Hours In Rain But I Have iPhone X. Personally, I bought a waterproof Bluetooth speaker that hangs on my shower rack, that way I don’t have to risk my $1000 iPhone X in the shower. That would be my first recommendation. 

If you are going to have it with you in the shower I wouldn’t recommend putting it directly in the stream of water, it’s “resistant” not “water proof.” If you have a shelf where it might get splashed, that’s safer, but you still want to try to avoid contact with water. 

On [Apple’s website about water resistance](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207043) it says the following. 

To prevent liquid damage, avoid these:
-	Swimming or bathing with your iPhone
-	Exposing your iPhone to pressurized water or high velocity water, such as when showering, water skiing, wake boarding, surfing, jet skiing, and so on

So like I said, maybe if you have a place where it might accidentally get a little splash, like a shelf or something up high, you could try that. But I would really recommend a waterproof Bluetooth speaker, they aren’t expensive, seen them for $40 and they sound better than iPhone speakers.. Buy either waterproof case or bluetooth speaker waterproof. Bluetooth speaker better option as sound be louder.. I wouldn't bring it in touch with any liquid. It's only officially waterproof, and Apple doesn't apply their warranty to water damage. Many people had broken or damaged phones because they dropped their phone into the pool, the sink or because they used it in the shower. Don't.. One more vote for Bluetooth speaker. DO NOT take in to the shower with you. Steam is reasonably safe (but not for 4-5 hours ofc), but not the direct water impact. Don't join the army of idiots that decided to swim in the pool with an expensive piece of tech.

If you'll still decide to take a shower with the phone, better make an encrypted backup before this.. Its not water proof, its water resistant. Don't bring it into the shower.

It can handle rain and whatever water it normally should come in contact with, but a shower is stretching it into a ridiculous territory.",357.0,7,34,0

Better to use iCloud or iTunes to get iOS to sync them for you.. If you’re using the iCloud Photo Library, then the photos are not stored on your phone, they are in iCloud. You would need to download them from iCloud.com if you want them on your computer.. Connect the phone when it's unlocked and wait for 30-60 sec (keep it unlocked).

If you’ve already restarted the device, you could try a factory reset. Make sure to backup the data through iTunes or iCloud first. Apple Support can also help you, either over the phone or online.

If all else fails, iPhone SE (2nd generation) is a very good option. It is incredibly future-proof and is amazing for the price. Otherwise, if you are looking for something a little cheaper, iPhone 8 is still a very capable device.

Hope this helps!. Does it sound like an underwater robot? I had this before. New SIM card fixed it. Have you tried swapping her sim into a known good iPhone?

Last time I had someone with similar issues it turned out to be an issue with the account somehow (unfortunately the user had already purchased new hardware). > not a tech kinda girl.

has it been updated (the ios)?  Settings > general > software update.    

also check

settings > cellular

can she turn on wifi calling?

check 'cellular data options'  is there an option for 'enable lte'?  (this is carrier dependent, so might not be there). Thanks for the reply!

I have reset her device and it had no effect. Her and her kids use the same carrier and although they are on newer phones I don't experience any issues when speaking with them.

IPhone SE is that newer than the 8?. Yes it does, but not constantly like that.. I had her try that and she does not have the option to turn on lte. It's there, but not enabled. She is with Virgin Mobile and I don't know if they have lte service.. Yes, it came out mid-April. It is an amazing device for the value! It has the A13 Bionic chip (currently found in the new iPhone 11 Pro), 4K video recording and IP67 water resistance (1m for 30 minutes). The US price is $399 for the 64GB configuration. If that sounds reasonable to her, it would be a good option. But otherwise, as I previously mentioned, the 2017 iPhone 8 can be found for relatively cheap online. Just make sure you’re buying from a reputable seller, if you decide on the 8.. not in the US?  virgin mobile us is now boost.

virgin mobile canada has lte I thought.

she might want to call whatever carrier she has and ask them to check her service.  maybe she's supposed to have the better voice calls. We are in Canada.. ok, yeah I guess it depends where you are

Many people are now using it as their primary mobile device now.

It’s fine for everything except hardware specific features of the 11 series.. I had an XS max and the battery life was about on par with my previous phone (note 9 exynos), now have the 11 pro max and its better than the battery on the note 10+ i had (also exynos). XS Max has a large size - and thus more battery. Although it has a bigger display too, the battery life on it should easily last you a day with normal usage. I have an iPhone X and it lasts almost a day for me so XS Max should easily do. Also, as many users pointed out, it is just one generation older and the A12 Bionic should last you a good 2.5+ years. One Plus 7 Pro is a great phone too, but the camera quality is mediocre when compared to an iPhone.. I’m a little late to the game , got an xs max new just a month ago. It’s good, battery life is not amazing since I came from an android device that has 5000mAh battery. But I can’t complain. Get about 4 hours screen on time for approx 40% battery usage.. I’m still using iphone 6+. Hardware mean nothing if your usage basic. Don’t follow new hype technology, buy what able afford. If I were to upgrade xs max the one I will choose. 👍. It’s an incredible phone for a great price comparable in every aspect to the 11.. XS Max has OLED screen my iPhone 11 still does not it’s a good buy. I have the XS max I bought brand new, couple thoughts.  Its an awesome well designed phone that takes great pictures.  The screen still look great and its actually pretty rugged, I dont use screens or nothing, just out here raw dogging life!  Yeah I understand the risks, and I have had to replace screens on different devices in the past.  But not this one, survived A couple decent falls!  When I first got the phone I took it on A trip to Japan, my GF had A 6, went an entire day using the phone pictures, texts, music everything!  Still had A ton of battery left, my GF was on an external charger before the midway point with the same usage.  But that comes with the territory, its starting to slow down now and the battery is getting old and starting to run down faster.  Although I love the phone and its will still be good after this year.  I am going to buy the new ""pro"" or whatever they are calling it.  Everything about it is going to be amazing not to mention its going to be 5G.  Theres this weird subsection of the internet that thinks holding onto A phone well beyond its useful lifespan is some sort of personality trait, we get it your too poor to up grade!  kidding, seriously just hang on A couple more months and get the new iphone, even the cheapest one is going to have A more powerful chip than the most expensive Android.. I don't think so.. Could I go for a full day with the XS Max with a few hours of use?. Still a while until I upgrade, but the XS Max is somewhere on the top of my list so far.. I don't know honestly, even the 64GB iPhone 11 is super expensive here ($900) and if the new iPhone will have the latest and greatest, especially 5G, it will be even more expensive, hence why I'm looking to get something a bit older, a 256GB XS Max costs about $650 atm which I think is a fair price. Easily. i think you should do a google search, the new phones are going to be starting at a lower price point this year. I really can't decide, either save up a little more and get a oneplus 7 pro, or the XS Max. Xs max, I switched from the note 10+ to the 11 pro max and don’t regret it at all, better battery life, much better speakers, and everything “just works” with my iPad Pro and AirPods etc",728.0,6,76,0

Done!”. Why not just sync your contacts on the old phone with some service and the.mn add the service on your iPhone?

Or use the migrate from android feature during setup.. If they are synced to Google then just make sure that you've signed in to the correct acc in Settings > Accounts&Passwords on iPhone (maybe sign out/in to fix any potential log in glitches). If yes, leave it charging with good Wi-Fi and not on battery saver for several hours.

Specifically for vCards, you should be able to add them through [icloud.com](https://icloud.com). If not, you can always do it with [iMazing](https://imazing.com/) or similar from the computer..

One more thing you could do is import the vCard to google contacts, sign in to the iphone with that google account and choose just contacts to sync.. Are you using iCloud online to import it?.

I did not have iCloud backing up messages for some reason. I also have no connected to iTunes in a very long time.  


Thanks for any advice.",2,1.0,2.0,"Not without jailbreak, there probably is a way, But it would require Too much effort. It would require you to take his message files, flip flop them for who sent/received, then put them in your file system. So basically without paying a jailbreak dev, no. If your friend can download the iMessage conversation (via, for instance, AnyTrans) and can oblige your request, they could send the conversation.

Beside that, it's just whatever you have in iCloud. You can't really retrieve it from the device or Cloud unless backed up (*not* *archived*; just a real-time copy — *sync* — or a copy with a few hours or days delay, unless overwritten/oversynced).

There's more intense methods (e.g., hardcore data retrieval labs) but don't have personal or professional experience with them.

I'm not very interested in phones or up to date with models and releases but I'm pretty sure it's an Iphone 8 plus and it probably has the most up to date iOS

2. Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

It's my work phone, I didn't buy it. I live in Sweden but this has so far only happened to me and my colleagues while working on a project in Germany.

3. What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

Today I saw it happen in front of my eyes, I pulled up my phone to take a picture and as I was about to snap the picture the screen just started showing thin white vertical lines on a grey background, the screen became brighter and brighter for thirty seconds until it went all black. It reacts to no buttons, nothing happens when I put in the charger, when I ask someone to call me it's like it's turned off. But last time it happened to me and to most of my colleagues, it will just start working in a couple of days again.

It occurs when we weld. At a certain stage of my job we have a 10 hour shift where we TIG-weld copper. It is somehow related to that because it always happen during that shift but while I'm annoyed I'm dying to know the exact cause. We only have DC in our TIG torches when welding copper. It's a fairly powerful welding machine able to output upwards 450 Ampere required for copper welding.

4. What caused the issue?

I'm not sure about the exact cause. Today when it happened the welding machine was turned on standing maybe 1,5 meters away but noone was running it since maybe 30 minutes. 

5. What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

Me and my colleagues try to not wear the phones in our pockets while we weld. We need to be able to take photos and to be reached, so I still kept them around, so I guess at this point a solution to have it not happen in the future is to keep the phone in another building as we do this but that's annoying.

6. Any other information you think might be useful.

We think it's only these newer Iphones it's happening to. But it also only happens when we're in Germany. Maybe that's all a coincidence but it's just so weird. I moved the SIM-card to another, older Samsung phone, and it's working fine. Maybe it's relevant, the item we weld is high voltage DC conductors for power transmission.

Does anyone have any ideas what it might be doing this, or how I could get my phone to start working again right away?",19,0.96,28.0,"No idea what is the issue here, but wow man, congrats on the perfect “help” post. I think I’m in love.. welding equipment puts out EMF like crazy.  we used to see welder's pickup trucks dying because it would fry the engine control module in them

electromagnetic fields can freak out electronics....why it's dead for a few days and not forever, I'm not sure.  maybe the battery goes into deep discharge and takes awhile to come back.

you could try one of those RF shielding bags or wrap it in foil, and then step far away when you want to use it.. Wasn’t there a story about a gas leak in a hospital that disabled all the iPhones until the gas  dissipated?. Nicely detailed post. 

If you ever find out the cause please let me know. I’m interested in figuring this out.. 2cents
“DC voltage is the only voltage that will attempt to turn into AC”
While welding with DC the voltage creates a frequency while the amperage heats up the metal to weld
I think the generator / welder has a problem leaking AC under load  or a bad internal ground or a bad phase. 
This is just a pure guesswork.. Are these cables live?. Your answer to #4 suggests a helium leak at the German site? 

&#x200B;

 (by now, others have already mentioned helium)

[https://www.ifixit.com/News/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium](https://www.ifixit.com/News/11986/iphones-are-allergic-to-helium). UPDATE: So 4 days since it died, I realized only yesterday how known the issues with Iphone 8 and helium were by googling ""Iphone 8 helium"", I saw the fixit article and even how Apples user guide says they don't go well together. So the link is definitely there, and it seems unnecessary for me to test my phone in a plastic bag since others have already done that and documented on youtube. 

Now it's not like I spray my phone with helium while we weld, and noone starts talking funny because of it but we operate in a 170m3 room, and during 8-12 hours we use up about 1½ 50l flask of helium pressurized to 200 bar. We seal the room as well as possible but we run the air in the room through a dehumidifier so I have no idea how much helium builds up. But it seems conceivable that with those conditions, enough of these little helium atoms could find their way into whatever part it is that makes this happen. 

I guess I can't be 100% sure this is the issue but it makes sense in a beautiful way, and it was really exciting to find about this. I read somewhere that Apple said to leave the phone to completely discharge for about a week before charging again should bring it back up, which matches our earlier experience. I guess in the future the best solution is to just not bring the phone to this workspace for this time. Which would be probably be the same solution as if I had concluded it would have been another aspect of this welding process that did the damage, but it still points to the gas.

Thanks for taking your time helping me out, it didn't cross my mind that it could be the gas before you guys brought it up.. Art.. Cool, thanks for your reply. It makes sense that weld -> EMF -> electronics acting up but it's just so specific that it keeps on happening here. We've used the same welding machines for other jobs but me and my colleagues haven't seen it happen anywhere but in Germany. That might just be a coincidence that we happen to be working here at the same time as we are being issued a phone that are sensitive to just whatever this machine does.

I googled deep discharge and that seems a bit scary, is it safe to me to leave the phone with charger plugged in while I sleep? Is there a solution to recover Iphones from this state or is it just not supposed to have it happening to them?. Yup! Gassed caused some sort of issue inside displays which lead to it not being able to be used (don’t remember too specifically) 
I think it was solved after putting it in a ziplock bag but idk for sure.. Helium. It's used to super cool magnets. Penetrates and kills the oscillator used for cpu clock timing. Remember this too! It was some sort of gas that leaked which caused internal components to run faster than normal which apparently wasn’t good.. Yeah it was related to one of the sensors that has like a tiny crystal in it and freaks out in the presence of some kind of gas or mri machine or whatever it was. I tried to find the YouTube video I saw for you but can’t find it :/. Nope, but there is risk of induced current due to nearby overhead lines. Although we never measured or noticed any problems with that but we do take precautions for this, grounding metallic parts.. I'd be curious if the phone is recognized by itunes on a computer when in that state.  or if it would response to a force reset.. Are they tig welding with high frequency a/c?. It's actually the oscillator not being able to function properly anymore.

Because of this the CPU freezes and isn't able to boot itself back up anymore. Helium is the shielding gas we use when welding copper. There's also nasty fumes so we wear a welding mask with ventilation on it. 

But it seems weird to me that gas could be the culprit when it only seems to target certain models of phones.. And induced current is where i was heading. But i think the helium could be the cause now that I've discovered you are using it.. It doesn't seem to respond to the things I try that I found from googling ""force reset iphone 8"".

The phone might be dead forever but I have my hopes up that it returns in a couple of days. Only DC for copper but machines are capable of running AC as well.. Any suggestion for how I could try to find out if this could be the cause? We use helium as shielding gas when we weld and there are some fumes that we avoid with ventilation.. Crazy. I think you found your link. I just assumed for whatever reason the shielding gas would have been argon or nitrogen or something.

Not all devices are made the same. It would make sense for this to be the cause, but not effect every device and location.

Try this. Triple bag your devices in zip lock bags (the helium will find its way in either way). See if it mitigates the occurrences to some degree. If you use helium, fat chance thats it. The symptoms match

Not sure how you could shield the phone from helium. I guess putting it in a baggie would help, but helium can actually propagate through the bag ever so slightly. But might be your best try to start with.

If it doesn't freeze when being in a sealed plastic bag, you can be fairly confident its the air mixture.. Crazy indeed, FYI helium is necessary for quality welding copper! And thank you!. Day 3, it's still dead but I'm thinking that if it starts working again, I might just put it in a plastic bag, vacuum it and then fill it up with helium outside, out of the presence of the welding machine, just to try this theory.. Just need to put a tiny bit of it in there, it's fairly sensitive.

No need to test it though, as helium is known for iPhones to give these issues.

Is it working now though? Usually takes 2-6 days until it works again depending on how much helium it has been in contact with",1300.0,25,463,0

I wasn’t even aware of what a cellular update was or that it was happening. It would not allow me to use cellular data at all. The only solutions to this were to update the phone or do a hard reset. It would be fixed immediately, if not by the next morning. These methods have been working for a few weeks, but last night and all day today it has said No Service all the time no matter what, and that in order to use cellular data on this iPhone, I have to update, but I can’t because it’s up to date at 13.5.1.

262,iPhone 11 screen problem,gydkg2,2020-06-07 14:39:29,"Hello this is an iPhone 11, which I had bought over 7months ago, I've been gaming on it on and off ever since March and I have been left with those pesky smudges which never go away, no matter how much I wipe using water and/or a soft cloth.

This is how it looks when I wipe it with some water

the partial area somehow appear to be hydrophilic? now. I mean water slides off easily from the other parts of the screen like it should however it simply stays on those spots as if something that had once been there repelling water is not there anymore? I'm not sure at all.

That part also feels a bit coarse and less smooth basically, and sometimes makes a sound that say a cleanly wiped wine glass would if you'd rub your finger against it",3,1.0,10.0,"You've rubbed off the oleophobic coating on those parts of the screen, which helps protect the screen from smudges (it's how fingerprints rub off really easily when you wipe your screen).

Oleophobic coatings are supposed to last for years but I guess if you keep rubbing/pressing the same spots it'll rub off sooner.  
How long have you been gaming on it (as in, hour-wise)?

Apple will likely see it as normal wear and tear, so the above question is important (because gaming on it for less than a couple of hours per day shouldn't do this, and should therefore be covered under warranty).. [images](https://imgur.com/a/wtSlQKz). I don't know but it is very well over a couple of hours a day. 

If I had to put a guess, cumulatively might've been over a hundred hours. Apple will regard it as normal wear and tear unfortunately (the same as any other manufacturer).

You might be able to make it disappear by applying a tempered glass screen protector (a tempered glass one specifically, as it will better mask where the coating has rubbed off).. yes I am planning to use a tempered glass but I was simply curious as to whether I can get rid of those patches before doing so.

however is there any way that one can do something by themselves? or is it not worth the risks associated with doing so. Get some IPA (isopropyl alcohol- *don't* use any other alcohol such as ethanol) and rub the screen, you won't need to use much force and the coating will start to come off.

Do this for the entire screen and then apply the tempered glass screen protector. Use a microfibre cloth to remove any fingerprints or dust before applying it.. so basically taking it all off to make it homogeneous, alright then.

also is there a way that after taking the entire thing off you can reapply an oleophobic coating evenly? 

which option would you go for actually, simply getting a tempered as it is rn or doing it after taking off the entire coating.. I'd remove the coating and then apply the tempered glass. I've seen products that claim to effectively re-apply the coating but have never seen one do what it says on the tin (aka, they don't work properly).

Search Google for ""macbook staingate remove coating"" for a step-by-step guide on removing it (the same problem of a coating coming off, but not the same root cause- will still apply here though).. thanks a lot :). They work properly if you use them as directed. I am speaking from experience with the Crystal Armor Fusso oleophobic coating. Applying it properly requires patience and time, but it works as long as you do it correctly. One bottle is about $15 and it is enough for 1 ***full*** application. That's why it's a tiny bottle.

Now, here is how you use it (all of these steps are actually pretty easy to perform, and they all count as 1 full application):

1. Apply 10-15 drops evenly over the glass. Don't try to be perfect, you won't be able to do it perfectly.
2. Before it evaporates, spread it evenly to cover 100% of the glass using something that doesn't absorb liquid. I used a squeegee. **DO NOT USE THE INCLUDED BLACK MICROFIBER CLOTH**. That's just a free gift included with your purchase to help you with your daily cleaning of the glass.
3. Using a facial tissue or a paper towel, simultaneously rub it in and wipe it off.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 above 3 more times for a total of 5 mini applications (not to be confused with a full application)
5. Repeat steps 1-**2** above just 1 time.
6. Let the evenly-spread oleophobic coating product sit untouched for 8 or more hours. This is the curing process. This is the critical stage most people don't have the patience for and it's why they say it doesn't work. Thanks to Voice Control, you can still use the iPhone without touching it. So set it up before you do all of this. Don't be fooled into thinking just an hour or two is good enough. 8 or more hours. The longer the better. That's just how this stuff works.
7. After the 8+ hours of curing time, wipe off the excess until the glass *looks* clean. Use a facial tissue or a paper towel or a clean cotton cloth that you're willing to put into the laundry basket after because this stuff is a little bit oily. Don't touch the glass while you're doing this, or after.
8. Now use a wet paper towel or a wet cotton cloth (not dripping wet, just wet enough to clean the glass) and clean off the remaining oily residue that I guarantee you cannot see but it's there. So again, I advise try to avoid touching the display glass until you've completed this step, otherwise it'll be on your skin. It's a subtle oily residue. I'm sure you don't want to accidentally get it in your mouth or your eyes or transferred to some of your belongings.

After step #8 above, you will have completed the 1st of 5 full applications. Do this for 5 days in a row, and I guarantee you the glass will feel just like new for the next 6-8 months, just like Apple's oleophobic coating. Again, I'm speaking from experience.

Edit: After 1-2 or even 3 full applications, you'll believe you've done enough applications because it will feel brand-new again, but don't be fooled. Make sure you do all 5 full applications.",916.0,4,140,0
263,I got locked out of my iPhone 8+,gy96g4,2020-06-07 09:29:50,"Hi everyone.

Two days ago, my iPhone of nearly 2 years stopped functioning normally. None of my alarms rang that morning - I couldn't click on anything. I restarted my phone a couple of times only to be stuck at the Apple logo for hours. 

I did a hard reset and plugged my phone into my laptop to get it into recovery mode. I had it install an update, but my laptop suddenly went on sleep mode and lost all its progress. I was left with no choice but to restore my phone. And I did. 

After restoring, my phone prompts a message to say about 'remote management' and that a certain company (I won't name) has control over my phone. An apple tech guy also walked me through recovery mode, but we got the same result. His hunch is that this phone used to belong to that company and only decided to lock it now (and that he'll help me escalate this problem next week, but that my homework is to contact the company). I restored my phone 4 times in total that day. 

Let's just say I wasn't received with warmth by the company, and they may not be the solution to my problem. I contacted the seller too, who was happy to reply and escalate to his supplier (he has 100% rating on eBay, and I was sure at least then that I bought this phone brand new - I even checked it with my serial ID and it says I have a valid purchase date). He said he'll keep me posted. 

I guess at this point, I'm trying to think about my options (buying a new phone being the very last resort). Is there any way I can go around this, or is my iPhone useless now? (I'm located in Australia, if that's of any help warranty-wise). 

Thanks in advance.",3,1.0,10.0,"Provide proof of purchase to Apple, where:

* Shows the device sold as new.
* Shows the seller's information where they are established as a business.
* The purchase date roughly aligns with the date the device was activated on (only Apple can see this, should be within a month or so of the purchase date).

If the proof of purchase has all the above, Apple should be able to validate you as the owner and be able to remove the remote management lockout.

  
Not sure how Apple's remote management works, but it might work by simply entering the serial number into the system- if so it's reasonable to assume the company it's now locked to entered one of the serial numbers incorrectly.. The restore is what triggered it.  The device was either owned by the company you won’t name, or by one of its employees and the enrolled it in MDM... and it was never un-enrolled.

From the companies point of view you shouldn’t have it, and unless they come to the table you are officially out of luck.. Awesome, I'll try this approach. Thanks so much!. That doesn’t work for remote management at all that’s for find my iPhone. Aaah no :( okay. I hope I can get some sort of refund from the seller.. No, it’ll work for remote management too. 

FMI requires additional proof of ownership than proof of purchase.. This is what I’ve done when helping people in the past.

If the eBay seller can provide proof that it was a new device, Apple may be able to remove the MDM, depending on the type of MDM it’s enrolled in.. [removed]. You opting to try and offend me says otherwise. MDM is a service offered by Apple for private companies via its Enterprise scheme, unlocking a device from MDM is not a legal issue if you are the legal owner of the device.

It was simply a suggestion, and I never said it would 100% work. 

However if Apple refuses to remove MDM with proof of purchase, the company who locked the device refusing to remove MDM, and the seller refuses to refund, I see no alternative but to take both that company and the seller to small claims (assuming the OP _really wanted_ their device back working properly). 

I’d imagine the initiation of a small claims against them would be enough to get them to remove it, and even if not you have documentation that verify beyond doubt that it is your device. 

MDM is monitoring software, not sure what the laws are over in the US but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was highly illegal to place spying software on someone’s device without their permission (or being a law enforcement agency).. I’m pretty sure MDM can’t be removed by Apple. The serial number is essentially in that company’s database.",472.0,8,313,0

This is why it's necessary to recalibrate the battery once every few months. Do it now. Here's how:

1. Allow the power to run out until iOS shuts down automatically
2. Plug it in and leave it plugged in until the iPhone finishes recharging to 100%. Don't unplug it until it's done. Note: it could take 1-2 hours for the iPhone to turn back on and start up after you plug it in. This doesn't happen when you regularly recalibrate the battery.
3. When it's finished charging to 100%, shut down the iPhone and unplug it.
4. Start the iPhone back up (so yeah, turn it back on)

Repeat this about 4-5 times. You can try to do it all in one day, or one time per day. It doesn't matter. 4-5 times will be necessary since this is likely the first time you've ever done it with this old iPhone.

After you're done with the 1st of 4-5 0-100% recharges, you will notice a big improvement to the battery level reading's accuracy and you might even get slightly more battery power before you have to recharge.

And yes, what is the Maximum Capacity reading? (it's not ""Battery Health"", it's ""Maximum Capacity"", located in the Battery Health section of the Battery settings).

Finally, do you restart your iPhone regularly? That keeps battery level readings reasonably accurate in between recalibrations.. the maximum capacity is 50% because of had this phone for a long time. will try. and the maximum capacity is 50%. Anything below 80% should be replaced (especially if you’re having power issues). Holy shit. Get the battery replaced ASAP.. yeah either that or i’ll just get a new phone. iPhone 11! :)

I have all the battery saving options enabled, I turned my brightness to the lowest, my Bluetooth is off, my volume is off and I have battery saver on. 

This battery drain started one day when my Touch ID decided to stop working. After that the bottom of my phone became extremely hot and then I noticed that it was charging a lot slower. Then the battery started draining worryingly fast.

I did some research and I came to the conclusion that I should replace my battery. I don’t want to waste money and replace it just for it to not fix anything, so I wanted to know if it would fix the extreme battery draining if I replaced my battery.

TL;DR Phone battery draining quickly, would replacing battery fix my problem?",2,1.0,5.0,"There is a PC application called 3utools which you can use to see how many cycles the battery has been through. iPhone batteries last about 500 cycles, so if yours is showing 400+ cycles, then it is worth considering replacing the battery. However, this may not diagnose any other faults or issues with the device. 

The issue of heating up whilst charging may be due to a dying battery or by a different issue.

You may want to ask the repair shop to have a look at the device (opening up and poking around) to see if there are any other issues and they may charge a fee for this.. Get new battery. I had same problem.. Okay, thanks for the help. Is the charge times the charge cycles?. One charge cycle is the battery discharge from 100% to 0%.

If you discharge the battery to 50% and charge it up. Discharge it to 50% and charge it up, then that is one charge cycle. 

As the battery ages from time and discharge cycles, it will become less efficient. By about 500 cycles, the battery would show approximately 80% capacity. The Iphone 6 capacity is 1810mAh, after 500 cycles, it would have about 1448mAh (80%). This will show up as ""100%"".",209.0,7,152,0

276,Intermittent cell signal loss. Apple blames carrier. Carrier blames Apple. Frustrated.,gxwrc8,2020-06-06 18:55:50,"**Summary of issue:** Several times per day, my iPhone 11 Pro will suddenly completely lose cell service. It’ll go from 4 bars to 0 bars, during which time I can’t place calls or use cellular data. This happens in several different geographic locations so it’s not a signal issue. Furthermore, my work phone uses the same carrier and doesn’t have these issues. After a minute or two, the service returns and it works like usual. 

**What I’ve done to try to fix it:** My first move was to call Apple since I have AppleCare+. Apple had me take several troubleshooting steps including checking for Carrier Setting Updates, Resetting Network Settings, and erasing the phone and starting over as a new phone. None of these solutions fixed my problem. 

Next, they had me call my carrier (FirstNet, which uses AT&T towers). My carrier reprovisioned the phone, and then sent me a physical SIM card to replace the eSIM which I had been using. Neither of these fixed the issue. 

Back to Apple, who me install a profile to collect more detailed Baseband logs. Engineers at Apple still blame my carrier based on the logs. 

I’ve been having this problem for over a month now. I told Apple I’d like a new phone since I think it’s pretty clearly a hardware issue. They warned me repeatedly that I’d be charged the full retail price of the phone if they aren’t able to replicate the issue. This issue is so infrequent that I seriously worry they won’t be able to reproduce the issue and I’ll be screwed out of $1,000. 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.",2,1.0,6.0,"> erasing the phone and starting over as a new phone. 

does this mean you've done a restore in itunes?  or just erased all the settings?

usually a restore is seen as a complete ground-up reinstallation of ios.  if that doesn't fix it, it's hardware.

so the apple techs haven't physically seen it?  are apple stores near you opened?   They might swap it out there if they can test it.

have you made records of when this issue occurs?  I guess you could contest it with your credit card company if they falsely charge you.  By then you'll have a new phone, hopefully that doesn't fail, so that's proof it was the phone.. Call apple again, explain what they are going through, and try to talk to a senior advisor. This is definitely some sort of failing baseband of a fucked resister near the sim tray. This is a very similar symptom on my iPhone XS Max and I have sent it out to Apple for a replacement. Currently waiting for mine.. Update: After the second Senior Advisor I spoke to on 6/4 failed to call me back on 6/6 as he promised, I called Apple today (6/7). The third Senior Advisor was very apologetic and was happy to set up an express replacement for me. Hopefully this issue will be resolved with the new phone. I’m fairly confident it will be.. I completely erased the phone and then restored from a backup. I guess I’ll erase the phone and then manually reinstall my apps to completely rule out a “tainted” backup. 

Unfortunately my local Apple Store is still closed. I’m thinking of making a bit of a road trip to the nearest open Apple Store because I’m guessing that a tech would swap it without making a hassle if I’m physically there and explain that I’ve been given the runaround for a month now.. I’ve be working with the same senior advisor for about 3 weeks. I called Thursday and talked to a different senior advisor. The latter was the one who warned me about being charged for a new phone. He’s supposed to call me back today with an update from their engineers. 

I agree it’s likely a failed hardware component, but trying to convince Apple of this is proving tough. If I don’t get a call back today, I’ll call tomorrow and roll the dice again on a senior advisor.. And one more update for anyone who cares. I had emailed Tim Cook about these issues. Just had a member of Apple’s Executive Team call me and he’s taking ownership of the case. Wow! Hoping the new phone fixes it though.",448.0,11,272,0

281,iPhone 7 recover photos/videos after Reset procedure possible?,gxucll,2020-06-06 16:44:23,"Hi,

I consider myself tech-oriented, have a lot of experience with tech gear, software, computers etc. Just to clear that line out.

Now, I don't personally use iPhone, my colleagues and friends around me do and I have limited experience, e.g. performed setup and registrations for friends in the past, installed few apps and so on.

And one important friend just had a **weird accident with her iPhone 7**. The internal memory was full, she cleared few old photos and videos to make some room for new ones, and decided to **restart (reboot)** the phone to see if it will make it run smoother.

And that's when the problem occurred. The phone shown a message that it is now **locked and to connect to iTunes to unlock it**. That message does not happen unless you make a mistake **10 times to try to unlock it (brute force protection)**, but she **denies** that that ever happened. It's her own phone, not stolen one obviously, and she **never changed her password** in the last 3 (or 4?) years.

Anyhow, she gave me the phone to try recover it, since her laptop is some ancient one on Win 7 and iTunes no longer works properly there (phone requires newer version).

I installed iTunes on my Win 10 laptop, everything went fine, phone was started in recovery mode, but during the ""update"" recovery procedure (non-destructive) phone stopped the update process, and iTunes reported that it cannot be updated because of an unknown error.

Ok, next thing, the only thing left, really, was factory reset via iTunes, I entered all the Apple ID and unlock pin credentials, and it was done.

**Phone is now factory clean. And it works 100% fine. But it is empty :(**

\*\*\* She DOES NOT have: \*\*\*

**1) any iTunes backups**

**2) iCloud or other cloud backups (iCloud was off)**

**Is there a \*\*\*beeping\*\*\* way to recover some photos and videos from her phone?**

AppStore is useless (US country), when I enter ""**photo recovery**"" in search, I get the whole crap apps in there. I'm all Android, at least we have **DiskDigger** and tons of other options (in particular, if we have external memory card storage).

Any, and I really mean, any app for Windows that advertises like crazy on Google for iPhone recovery is useless, since they either find no photos at all, just calendar and similar things (unimportant) or require **iTunes/iCloud backup** something. I have tried at least 10 of them, and traditional apps like Recuva and alike do not see iPhone as a storage device, since it's mounted like a media something crap (MTP device).

Sorry for the long post, but my Saturday is ruined anyway, and is there any way that really works?

I got an idea to use **iExplorer** to mount it as a **FAT32 Windows drive**, and it was like hell hard to find a matching iTunes version that will work with iExplorer properly, but it was a no go, either. Software like **Recuva** complained about unrecognized file system, and **Stellar Phoenix** *something* successfully scanned it (in like 5-6 minutes, which was odd), but didn't find a thing. It's a virtual device driver that goes through iTunes, so it was a long shot anyway, but still... pity.

I can run a **Linux Ubuntu** disk, but not sure how the device is going to be mounted there and what recovery apps options are available. Does anyone have any idea in this regard?

Any idea?

BIG thank you!",2,1.0,5.0,"No I’m sorry, there’s most likely no way you could restore them, even with a Linux restore utility, since when the phone is reset through the 10 attempts it’s securely erased over and data is written over several times to get rid of any chance of recovery. Impossible to recover content after a reset unfortunately.. No, even if the data was still there (which it isn’t because it securely erased), the data is encrypted with a unique identifier which is different with every factory reset. So when you reset, the drive gets reencrypted with a new and different key, making recovery impossible. This is done on purpose and is a safety feature. 

Live and learn, iCloud backup was turned off (default is on), so they made that choice of not having backups.. Thank you, all for your replies. I was afraid that this was the case :(. Thank you.

285,iPhone X won’t start up. Stuck on Apple logo.,gxr5vz,2020-06-06 13:39:28,"Hello, I am looking for some help with my girlfriends iPhone X. 

First let me give you the details,

It’s an iPhone X, not sure on the firmware. I think it was 13.3. I bought it from my friend second hand for her but there weren’t any issues other than the back glass being smashed. Haven’t had any other issues with the phone until today. Hasn’t been dropped, no water damage and haven’t tried to update it and anything happen midway through so I’m at a loss to the problem. 

My girlfriend woke up this morning to her phone not turning on after being on charge overnight. I have tried the hard reset as well as recovery mode and dfu mode but her mac doesn’t recognise the phone when it is plugged in but it recognises mine so the problem lies with the phone not anything else. 

When plugging into the wall to charge it gives the battery charging indication and then starts to boot up with the Apple logo but won’t go past that. It will sit on this screen forever.

Basically I’m just wondering if anyone experienced this or has any advice of what to do next. 

I spoke to Apple support but they only told me everything I already knew then gave me a quote of £600+ to fix it which is ridiculous when I only paid £100 for the phone. 

If there is nothing I can do then she’ll just get a new phone but if it’s possible to fix it I wanna give it a go. 

Thanks in advance for reading my post and if there’s any info I missed out please let me know!",2,1.0,16.0,"If DFU doesn’t work, you’re looking at a hardware issue.  Apple’s ‘repair’ would probably be hardware replacement. Might be the face ID flex cable, or charging port cable. If you unplug one of them it might work. I have experience with this! This usually happens when an iPhone with FACE ID (iPhone X, xs, etc...) has some sort of damage with the rake piece assembly. If you can open the phone up and disconnect the earpiece ribbon, your phone will boot right up, and you can use it again, of course with no Face ID. I would recommend going to a phone repair shop, suggest them to disconnect the earpiece ribbon and try turning it on. This is the exact same issue I had with my iPhone XS and using that same device to write this, with the assembly disconnected. This can definitely end with a $30 repair.. ew, doesn't sound good.  if itunes doesn't recognize it, it's probably a hardware issue

try cleaning out the lightning port with a toothpick, try a different cable, different  computer if possible.

do the freezer trick (seal it in a plastic bag, put in freezer for half an hour).  then see if itunes sees it. Doesn’t sound promising!. Interesting! Are you able to use Face ID again now? Can you replace the part in question?. This worked! Phones up and running with the earpiece ribbon disconnected. So if I replace the earpiece part it will fix the problem and allow the earpiece to be used? Is the reason the Face ID won’t work because of encryption? Is there a way to get the Face ID to work with a new earpiece part without getting Apple to do it?. Thanks for the reply! Cleaned the lightning port already, tried multiple cables and even tried a windows laptop. All no good. I haven’t tried the freezer trick though so I’ll give that a go!. The freezer trick will do nothing for a phone, please do not suggest it.  
It can cause damage to the battery.  


OP needs to send the device to a microsolderer for a diagnosis.. You can replace the part and earpiece will work again but FACE ID will never work unless the screen is replaced by apple. I’m glad the phone is back up and running! Unfortunately, the earpiece has the proximity sensor as well as the flood illuminator(crucial for FACE ID) and they are paired to the phone. Therefore, unless replaced by apple it can’t be brought back to life. There are people with “GSX Accounts” but they aren’t legit most of the time and kinda shady to about.

Everything seemed fine, including music. And then I tried to make a phone call. No sound, and the speaker button is dimmed.

I even tried toggling airplane mode on and off because somebody recommended it. Bluetooth has been on and off too. Nothing has worked so far.

Many thanks for this tip. I'll un-sync and see if it makes my life better.. Ah, no go -- the keyboard shortcuts still sync instantly :(

I'll see if anyone else has tips! I would just go to an Apple store and ask, but I don't think they are open yet.. Emails & messages will still sync.  The biggest impact would be if you use iCloud Drive to store & access files like documents from both devices.  iCloud Drive is also involved with storing Home app data.

Did a newly added iPhone text replacement sync after you turned iCloud Drive off?  Or was it a replacement that was already synced?  If the latter, it is because you have to delete the existing ones on the Mac.  They are under System Preferences > Keyboard, Text.. So after turning it off, I went into my iPhone keyboard and deleted the laptop keyboard shortcuts. Then I went into the laptop keyboard, and it had already syncd with my iphone.

Why do you hate The phone so much. Something is wrong with your phone. Also it is quite a downgrade, as with the note 10, you get a much better screen. Maybe return it and go with one of the pros.. Well I hope it wasn’t from wish.com. I agree. iPhones never lag, especially when they’re new.. it's slow, does a lag thing when I rotate youtube videos, does the auto hang up whatever thing, small screen, screen isn't sharp and bright like the Note 10, shitty speakers, poor call quality. If your iphone is lagging somethings not right,speakers on iphone are always the best stereo speakers on any smartphonehence audio for calls and mic should be flawless,i think somethingswrong with your phone and sou should do favtory reset or take it to Apple Store,seriously iphone speakers are always the best,and iphone is the most snappiest phone so 0 laggs should occur,i had galaxy s8 huawei p30 pro and now iphone X 0 lags never ever,(so u know i am android fan aswell as iphone fan) speaking objectively iphone speakers should please you,call quality aswell and lagg should not occur,but if the screen size is thst kuch of an issue to you why bother switching in the first place?

Every other iphone in the lineup has one of the best for screens on the market but yet he gets the smallest and worst and then wonders why he hates it.

Depending on the genre/song, music is sometimes unlistenable for me because of the distortion. At 50% volume they sound good tho.. I mean screen isnt that bad tbh,but he has named like 5 more thing that bother him,ehich are simply not true,i onow ppl who got 11 regilar one and speakers are so fkin loud same goes for call quality,and in terms of lagg there is none becuse apples software and hardware implementation,main reason why people still choose iphone over anything elae is longevity and smoothnes even on 60hz displays",411.0,10,53,0

Hi,

I recently purchased a iPhone Xs after owning an Android phone for several years.

It's been a long time since I last owned an iOS phone and I forgot that unlike Android, iOS has a lot of limitations on what files you can access on the phone.

I am currently using iTunes and the File Sharing option to try to access files and while I can see a list of file sharing apps as well as the root directory for each file sharing app...I am not able to drill down and open any of the folders/sub directories to add or copy files inside of the folders.

I can however add or copy files and folders on the root level.

Why does Apple allow access to the root directory for each file sharing app to add or copy files or folders but then restricts us from opening the folders in order to add or copy files inside of the folders?

Kind regards,

314,"Iphone 7 ""cellular update failed"" bug - 2 different phones?",gwsx3m,2020-06-04 23:28:14,"Hi There, post addresses: 

\-Iphone 7, 128gig,  running IOS 13.5 (up to date) 

\- purchased 1 week ago via Amazon in the U.S.

First I should address I am aware of the bug causing the ""cellular update failed"" on some iPhone 7's specifically. Makes the phone think it has no service etc. I know you can (or could?) return to Apple for a fix.

My original iPhone 7 (which I had for many years) NEVER had this problem. I just had dropped it, broken the camera, drained the battery, etc and it was time to replace. I'm broke AF at the moment and wanted to go for a cheaper refurb option. So I got the same iPhone 7 with the same specs but refurbished from BestBuy. One day in had this problem. Returned it - bought another one from Amazon. Again, it had this problem but except this time on and off sometimes for days at a time. 

THE QUESTION IS: is there any world where two separate model# iPhone 7's have this issue - or could this be a problem with my AT&T account or my sim card (the only common denominator between the 3 phones). I know a refurb is a sketchy option but I just don't want to spend the cash on a new phone - especially if this can be fixed. Again, the original iPhone7 with the same sim card NEVER had this problem.

or do you mean you can no longer access the phone?  you might need to reinstall the apple drivers:

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204095


if on the icloud, try the icloud for windows app. Plug your iPhone into your pc, go to windows explorer, find your iPhone, right click -> import photos and videos.

This can also be done through the very buggy windows 10 photos app if you have windows 10.. Just use google photos you can then later delete them off your phone. You need to update your iPhone to the latest and you will be able to. I had the same issue. Now I am ok to see, copy and paste the media to my PC. Finally gave up on this myself after over a year of struggling. Tried at least a half dozen things multiple times, using multiple PCs and multiple iPhones. Now I just back up to the cloud in triplicate:

1. Amazon Photos - unlimited photo storage with Prime, only a few GB of video.
2. Google Photos - free backup of all photos and videos at reduced quality
3. OneDrive - I have a Microsoft 365 subscription, so currently 1TB space. This is my master, saving all photos and video at full quality.

I use Google Photos to delete the photos/videos after they are backed up to all three. If you can't see the DCIM folder, connect the phone while it's unlocked and wait for 30-60 sec.

If you get Disconnected error, go to Settings > Photos and change to ""Keep originals"" at the very bottom (there's a known issue with errors during HEIC > JPEG conversion step).

If still won't work (issues with transferring 4k videos), get [iMazing](https://imazing.com/). Never had any troubles with it for photos transfer.. They remain on the iPhone. I just get failures when I try to import or only 30 of 200 pics import.. Just use google photos :). This happened to me as well. So what I did was copy the photos in batches.

317,Is this possible?,gwrlht,2020-06-04 22:17:02,"Hey guys! I have an app on my iphone 7 that came available for a short amount of time, it's an app that can cache you tube vids and songs/play vids in the backround etc.. It's like an 'itube' app.. its amazing.. but not available anymore AS you can imagine. I think i downloaded it in 2017.

Basically i cached THOUSANDS of videos on there, made LOTS of playlists of helpful videos for my studies/research/life/ business etc which i love reflecting back on when need be. It's like my pocket dictionary so it's basically REALLY important that i keep all the content on there in the format that it's all in.

Now my iphone 7 is currently facing possible software issues and apple have told me i need to a hard reset of the phone and this will mean i will lose this app and there is no way to download it again..

Now for the tech gurus, Is there anyway i can get the contents on that app and the app itself OFF my iphone 7 and onto my laptop or something? Or a way to save and be able to retrieve the app and it's content in the same way i left it after hard resetting my phone?",1,1.0,16.0,"do they show up in the 'files' app?

or when you connect a cable to your laptop, can you browse them like a drive?. Are you able to backup your phone?

++ If yes you should be able to back up then reset your phone and restore from backup. Or an program like iExplorer might be able to help. Yes you can get it back does it show on you’re purchasing. Where was the app from originally?

Depends if it saves things in a format and location you can get to.. No you can’t do either :/. Well i think so? I know i can back up photos/notes etc etc to icloud or transfer on to laptop but what other back up can you do? Can you backup all apps data etc??. its not there unfortunaetly. App was just on the App Store! It’s actually imusic. Yes, so through iTunes you can do a full backup of your phone (this includes app data, messages, photos, notes, settings preferences, etc etc)

To do this:

1. Plug in your phone into your computer
2. Click trust this computer on your iPhone if it pops up
3. Open iTunes on your computer, you should see an iPhone icon on the left side of the screen
4. Click the iPhone icon and you will see a screen about software updates and backups
5. Click “backup to this computer”, then click apply at the bottom right
6. Click “back up”
You should now see a progress bar at the top of the screen indicating the progress of the backup, as well as a sync animation in the status bar of your iPhone

Once the backup is complete you will see a message that says “last backup on [date] [time]”

++once you have your phone backed up you will be able to restore your phone with that backup once the issues are fixed. Or you can put the backup on any iPhone running an iOS version the same or higher than the backup. Where does it save stuff?. Your amazing! Thank you..

Is this the right section??  Your telling me that if i tick off 'Back up all data from this iphone on mac'  and then 'back up' and that will just back up the data from an 'Imusic' app that has private app storage??

[https://imgur.com/a/0ZvCkAw](https://imgur.com/a/0ZvCkAw). It saves stuff within the app! So the app has a search function (you tubes search engine) you search a vid and it instantly downloads it to the app. Yup! As long as the app is still on your iPhone which it sounds like it is... Also make sure you know your encryption password, if you lose / forget it gaining access to that backup will be impossible.. Private app storage is often not accessible from outside the individual app.

What sort of issues is the iPhone 7 having?. Yeah it’s on my iPhone right now! Okay that amazing !! Thanks again. Yeah seems that way, No way to take the data of the app and 'move' it somewhere either??

Complain on apple chat support that the phone is NOT physically damaged and you didn’t do anything, they’ll send you a box to ship out the phone in free.

If it is a board issue, Apple will only offer to replace the whole device and all non-backed up data will be lost. If you have a 3rd party repair shop in your area that can do microsoldering then they should be able to narrow down what’s going on and be able to determine if it’s actually repairable or not. May times it’s cheaper to repair the board than replace it through Apple.

I want to downgrade my iphone 10R to a smaller model. This phone is in very good condition.

I used to have the original iphone SE. Could get it for about 150. The new SE seems to be around 400.

I’m essentially wondering how much value I could get out of my current phone if I were to trade it in. It’s in very good condition like I said. Would they give me a straight swap for the new SE? Would I have to pay 100 bucks or so? More than that? 

Like I also mentioned, the SE original is about 150 online. Would it be a mistake (from a financial standpoint) to try and sell my current phone and buy the original SE? I’m trying to get as much value out of this as I can.

It tells me the trade-in value is $300. So that means you would get the new iPhone SE for $149.00 after they receive your iPhone Xr. So, you'd pay $449.00 up front.. Your phone on the streets can be sold for more than an SE is worth.. Appreciate that man. Cheers. Check on https://Swappa.com",118.0,5,191,0

Anyone have any ideas?  

Additional info:  

When I first finished the battery replacement I realized the ribbon cable that connects the charger port and microphone were unplugged.  I plugged them back in and the phone was boot looping.  I then realized that when that ribbon cable was unplugged I could boot the phone all the way up, but obviously the phone wouldn’t charge and I’d have no microphone.  I then found a happy medium where I’d plug the ribbon cable in, but only gently and then I’d have a working phone, until the Taptic Engine went out the next day.   

Is the microphone/charger port that connects to the main board in any way related to the Taptic Engine?  I’m wondering if there’s some damage to the ribbon cable connection that is causing all the problems...?  I’m tempted to open my phone back up to mess with that one ribbon cable that was causing the boot loop issues to see if I get anything at all out of the Taptic Engine.

There's way too much anxiety around this. Just enjoy your iPhone.. I’ve had this enabled, but it doesn’t always activate. I’d just like it to charge to 80% always unless I disable the feature manually. 

I haven’t looked at jail breaking it, and would rather avoid it if it’s just for this feature. I’m not terribly anxious about it - just want the battery to last over the long term.. Charging past 80% won't hurt it.

Probably not, Apple was having issues with their iCloud servers earlier, that might have something to do with it.

**Phone Model:** iPhone SE

**Purchase date:** within the last two weeks; my family ordered them as a group

**Country:** United States

**Nature of purchase:** personal use

**OS:** not sure, probably the most recent one

**The issue:**

I recently switched to iPhone from Android, and did not have an Apple ID until today.  I created one and linked it to my email, but have not been able to link it to my phone number.

iOS appears to have created a Catch-22, where I can't send or receive texts through iMessage, or receive calls on the call function, because I haven't activated my phone number on Apple ID; and I can't activate my Apple ID because doing so requires me to receive either a text message or a call on this phone.

**What caused the issue:**
It just came this way.

**Attempted solutions:**
I've tried sending a text message to myself (it failed to send), and I've checked my email and spam folder for iMessages I could have received (none found), since one of the settings says I can receive iMessages there too.

I also tried turning off iMessage in the Messages settings.  This still hasn't allowed me to send messages to myself, which makes me think there might be some kind of problem with my phone number not being attached to this phone.

Does anyone know a way to get around this problem?  I get the sense there must be something I'm missing, since anyone switching to iPhones would run into this problem.",1,1.0,3.0,"I would try this: first try signing out of Apple ID, ejecting the sim, restarting the phone.

Perfectly fine!. Oh yes it did. But I don’t get it. It doesn’t blur any other apps to show preview, why Snapchat?. It’s because the screen you are on has potentially private information on it. Banking apps do the same thing if they are developed well. 

I’d imagine if you go to the home screen Instead of a chat it won’t blur?

Banking apps should also do this if developed well.. Here’s some proof for you, mine is exactly the same when I switch out from being in a chat window.

Simplest way is just to save a ton of screenshots. Would take some time though.. Not helpful for you, but as somebody that’s needed to do this, having a MacBook 💻 was very helpful .  If you have a MacBook you can simply copy the files.  I know this doesn’t apply to you, but for anyone else reading it’s pretty simple on the Mac. Another vote for third-party apps. Keeping such important messages in PDF, in several locations (on Google Drive, locally and on external drive, for example) should be more than enough to keep them safe. [iMazing](https://imazing.com/) is good (PDF export customization, exact layout, good search option if needed), but basically any app with messages export will work.. Which files do you copy?. I think if you search some strings from your conversations in Finder it will show you where they’re stored, then just copy that folder. I see. You see?  You were able to find it?.

iPhone 8
13.3.1
2017 sometime, Canada
No warranty 



Problem:

• for the past week and a bit, I’ve frequently had calls on my phone and discord cut in and out or sound distant from either end, interchangeably. My battery also, seems to be draining quicker. (My battery is at 88% the capacity as when store purchased)


Replicating:

Making a call or receiving a call by phone or calling app. 
Battery obviously drains itself. (It can be sitting and drain around %5+ within half an hour.)


What I’ve tried:

Sliding the sounds bar up and down, silent mode off, turning off many background apps refreshing, deleting some apps. Problem persists. 


Possible causes:

3 months ago, I purchased some cheap ear buds to use and they seemed to permanently mess up the way it reacts to headphones. It will trigger Siri when putting apple headphones in and it will rapid cycle through music or pause and play as if possessed etc. I no longer use headphones with it. 

Other notes:

As I type this, I noticed when an alarm came on, it displayed the volume button as if I were altering it from the external buttons. 

Body of phone is not hot; app battery consumption looks like what I’d assume it to be. 

I hear back and forths as to whether or not iPhone can contract malware. I use an ad blocker and try my best to stay away from any site I’m unsure of. I regularly clean the safari cache and monitor my network. 

Not trying to come across as paranoid, just not sure 100% what to attribute it to. I’m pretty opposed to factory resetting but if it’s the only solution, I accept that. But I’d love any other suggestions.

With iPhones my usual ‘fixing’ method starts with doing a hard reset, and if that doesn’t improve things making an encrypted Finder backup, then DFU restoring with an ipsw of the current iOS.

It’s possible that the headphones have messed up the lightning port or controller chip.. Hi, no jail breaking or side loading. 

I hope it hasn’t messed up the actual port and that if I were to reset, that will fix too.. Unlikely to have malware then.

run itunes on a computer, hook it up to the phone, and do a manual backup to that computer.  if you normally backed up to icloud, that's fine, this will give you another version you can delete later if not needed.

Do a restore iphone.  if it says to turn off 'find my' and you can't on the phone, go to icloud.com and remove that device (you just add it back later)

if a full restore doesn't fix it, it's a hardware issue.  could be the touch screen. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**

I was trying to open my sim-tray earlier with a paperclip... Long story short the clip broke off inside the sim-tray.

I can't get it out. Is this a huge problem? I.e. is there any risk to the internals of the phone?",7,0.89,6.0,"There is a small pin that goes between your device’s housing and the internals, that sits in the SIM eject hole. 

You’ll be fine and should be able to continue to eject the SIM card by using a stronger paper clip, or a stronger SIM eject tool.

In the rare case that you have had your device previously serviced and this pin fell out, and the technician forgot to put it back in, you’ll need to take your device to a repair shop so they can open it and remove the part of the paper clip that is stuck (they should only need to lift the screen up, they shouldn’t need to disconnect anything for this).. I would say it's not a huge risk as there aren't that much moving parts inside the phone. It might eventually block the rotating part of the vibrator, or just get picked up bij the magnet of one of the speakers. The sim-tray is close to the mainboard, so there is a small change it might short something out.  

Free space inside the iPhone is very limited. It depends on the size of the part that broke off to determine if it will be stuck inside the sim-tray or will move inside the phone.

I did repairs on iphones that had had loose parts and screws inside of them, and they all still worked. To be safe, back up your data regularly and maybe get the piece removed by a repairshop.. It cannot block the vibrator. The vibrator wasn’t the old exposed style since the iPhone 4.. There is a small pin that blocks the way, unless the OP had their device serviced and this was removed and the technician forgot to put it back in, it is not possible for it to make its way to the components..

I want to buy a new phone but there’s seriously so many options and I really don’t know what to go for. I intend to watch some videos and do some research myself but if anybody could point me in a direction. I could afford a grand for one like the 11 pro, but it would be quite expensive for me if that makes sense. Not rich at all.

The XR has same internals as XS and 11 has same internals as 11 pro, just smaller battery, less cameras, and lcd. LCD is very high quality and its literally perfect. 

I say buy a brand new XR(if you can find one) or a Brand new 11. The screen is 6.1 inches(compared to 5.8 and 6.5 inches on 11 pro and max respectively) and has an amazing display. Battery life is very long, and can even last you two days with a battery case. 

I say don’t buy anything 8 plus or below. Not worth it for the money rn. Also, X would be the lowest I would go. Btw, be careful when buying pre-owned or used. Check the IMEI, check the ESN status, and make sure they are paid off. Also, be sure the displays don’t have too much burn in if you are buying a OLED display phone.

It’s a red iPhone 11 with 64gb with the box and accessories 
Used for around 5 months with Apple warranty till late December
Price :$570usd 
is it worth it over a $450 iPhone XS gold 64gb with no warranty? 
What’s my best bet?
I have the iPhone 7 32gb rn btw",1,1.0,8.0,"I guess it depends on if you want the better camera system and the much better battery life. Otherwise, the Xs has 3D Touch and an OLED display, if the display is important to you (it's not to me).

I'd rather recommend the used iPhone 11 though since it still has the warranty for 5 months. I don't know whether they're transferable though.. First make sure both devices work well with your carrier. Test the with a sim and insure both function and don't have the sim lock screen come up. Next Ask if both devices are fully paid off and check with the carrier to insure they are paid off. You do not want to purchase a finance device that gets black listed a few months later.  I personally would prefer the XS. It has more premium construction, oled display, and is cheaper. Only improvement I see with the 11 is night mode for the camera, normal day use is very similar. CPU upgrade between the XS and 11 isn't really noticeable during daily use. Both would be fine upgrades for your 7 32gb.. In most places warranty is linked to the device, so it is transferable. But is it worth the risk buying it off someone(iPhone 11)? Xs is in a phone store. How do I check with a carrier if they’re unlocked?. Oh. You sold me on the idea of getting the Xs instead.. What I would do normal is first ask the seller. If he/she is a part of ebay or swappa and says its unlocked it should be fine. (if you get scammed just contact ebay or swappa for a refund) If its a private seller or on some other marketplace like facebook marketplace ask for the imei and what carrier it belong to. Next depending on the carrier there is either a website portal to check if the device is unlockable like at&t or you must contact support like Sprint. I would avoid a device where the seller is vague or unwilling to give you the information as those are huge black flags.. They both are used so I’m not sure what’s my best bet",361.0,3,49,0

481,About a month into moving from Android and I hate it. Is there hope?,gqsrex,2020-05-26 07:55:04,"I've been using Android since day one. I finally decided to make the switch after breaking my Galaxy S10 and receiving an iPhone 7 for free from a friend.

I'm aware that I took a massive step back as far as hardware goes, but I still feel like the baseline experience is lackluster and I'm really frustrated. I have a suspicion that hardware isn't the source of my issues and it's more of an iOS problem. Hopefully you can fill me in.

My first complaint is the notifications. I miss shit all the time. It seems like if I don't see a text as it comes in I lose it to the ether. Android has persistent icons in the top bar to indicate notifications. As far as I can tell the only equivalent in iOS is the badges on icons. Am I missing something important?

The second and definitely most annoying is the keyboard. I can't type worth a damn on this thing. It autocorrects words for seemingly no reason. I've tried using gboard to help the transition but it seems to be suffering from the same issue. Is there an OS level problem here? Am I just used to nicer screens?

Almost everyone else in my life is on iPhone so I would like to try to make it work. I'm not opposed to shelling out for a new phone if it will solve my issues. I just saw the free phone as a great chance to try it out.

Did I miss the boat? Should I just go back to where I belong?",0,0.33,4.0,"For notifications that you missed, swipe down from the status bar at the top to see the Notification Center. I think Apple opted for this so that they could have less stuff on the status bar (less clutter, I guess).

To see older notifications while viewing the Notification Center, swipe up from around the middle.

For the auto-correct problem, yeah. I have it disabled. Settings > General > Keyboard.. Text notifications can be set to repeat themselves up to 10 times so you don’t miss them. Also all notifications are grouped together across your lock screen if you have it set up that way. I had an Android system before and didn’t care for the text notification because when you turn the preview off you wouldn’t be able to see who the text was from until you swiped down from the top. 
As far as keyboard I think it could be better in regards to having the numbers there as well instead of touching the number pad to get it and then back again to type letters. You get use to it. But there will always be the debate that Apple sucks and Android rocks vice versa. Don’t go by any forms you read unless their helpful for the task at hand. The ultimate decision will be your preference on what phone and platform works for you. Good luck.. For notifications, the Notification Center shows on the lock screen as well as being able to get to it from (I think) the top (I’ll double check when I get on an older model with a home button).

For typing, it might just be you’re not used to the keyboard... what sort of words are being autocorrected?

Ultimately, if iOS doesn’t do it for you, it’s better to use a device (and OS) that does.. Change back. It was a free phone.",307.0,14,260,0

504,IPhone XR help,gq59z2,2020-05-25 05:38:14,"So i recently have bought an iPhone XR for a good price. Its works and looks good but there is a major problem.

Second, every time i use the front flash it freezes. I use the front flash and the shutter button stays pressed and the screen wont read my finger until i pressed the side button. This even happens on applications like insta and snap. For some reason i think it could be a LCD issue? Because the screen looks different different (it has some sort of yellow hue and colors seem a bit off). I want to take it to apple but the warranty expired and i just don’t want to spend like 700$. Anyone ever faced an issue like this? Please help. Thank you",1,0.67,13.0,"Sounds like the display has been replaced and wrongly as well that’s why affecting the Face ID functionality.. the yellow hue could be true tone or night shift.

I think im just gonna pay 200$ so apple can replace it properly. Its not that. Its like a hue thats like very faint but one that you can tell when you compare it side by side. Thank you though. Yea do check it with them. I’m not sure whether Apple would fix devices that have been repaired by 3rd parties.. Does the true tone option show up? If not, that is a sign that the display has been exchanged by a unauthorised repair shop.. Awe really :(. No true tone :( do you think apple can repair it?.

507,iPhone X on reboot loop,gpxdi7,2020-05-24 21:04:02,"My iPhone X is currently in a reboot loop and unresponsive. It is not backed up to iCloud. 

Background: This happened last night after it hit maximum storage and I attempted to back my phone up to iCloud, which seemed to overwhelm my phone's processing capacity (apps wouldn't work, etc). I canceled the back-up and tried to clear some space, but then wasn't able to actually delete photos/videos. I opted to turn my phone off and on again, but it went into the reboot loop after I tried to turn it on. I tried a hard reset without success, and my phone would not be recognized on iTunes or finder when plugged into a MacBook or PC. 

When I was on the phone with Apple support, the specialist walked me through trying to get my iPhone in recovery mode and trying to update it. I was able to get iTunes to recognize my phone and begin the update process, but then it told me my phone could not be updated because of an unknown error (14). I know restoring is an option, but I'm trying to figure out any way to not lose data. I would do anything and pay any amount to avoid that. I'm looking into 3rd party recovery software, but unsure if that is the safest bet. I am planning on taking my phone in to an Apple store if stores open up again. 

No need to remind me how stupid it is to leave your phone without backup for so long as I am well aware and beating myself up for it :( pls help",4,0.84,15.0,"A couple more thoughts:

* My phone is at like 255.9/256 GB, so it may not have enough storage to even install an update. This sounds dumb, but if there is a way to somehow clear up storage without turning my phone on, that might help (i.e. deleting imessage data via macbook, etc)
* I've now seen several threads where people got their phones to work by smacking them. I am continuing to attempt that.
* I have an apple watch (w/out cellular) connected to the phone, if that can be helpful at all.
* Will legit venmo anyone who helps me figure out a solution without losing my photos/videos. I don't care about anything else.. What ios is it on?. I'm just curious, what prompted you to turn off backup (or never turn it on)?. Error 14 is a bad cable. Try a new Apple genuine cable. 

Also try another computer with newest iTunes.. I can't give you an exact answer without my phone powering on, but I can say it isn't 100% up to date but also has been updated in the last 6 months if I'm guestimating correctly. I'm trying to find out if there's another way to find this info.. I've tried turning it on in the past, but it just overwhelmed my phone and wouldn't even process the request. so here we are.. I used several different genuine cables and the newest iTunes. I read somewhere that error 14 could also be a storage capacity issue, which makes sense. It could be why the update usually starts then stops at about 30%.. If you can get it into DFU mode then plug it into your Mac and open and old version of checkrain and boot it up with that. It boots from the computer not the phone, so it may work.. Which iPhone do you have?. Which version of checkrain is the old version? And would I be able to retain my data if it isn't backed up?. iPhone X - not sure which iOS. You will be able to keep your data, and any version that makes you put the phone into DFU mode before you start the process. Did that work?. That's really strange.. I checked to find checkra1n, but the beta version does not seem to be recommended so I did not go through with it. Based on my current situation, several folks have advised that a jailbreak wouldn't actually solve the main issue. I'm really just trying to figure out if there's any way to recover some of my data (photos/videos) before I wipe it. I did try minitool and 3uTools. Both had the same problem - I don't have enough storage for any kind of OS update. I think I might try the premium version of dr.fone next.",464.0,5,269,0

Who rinses off a cell phone under water?. Are you saying you'd like to try to fix it yourself? I recommend not doing that and instead taking it to Apple to have them fix it. They will open it up safely and correctly, they will fix it safely and correctly, and they will put it back together safely and correctly. Doing it yourself is risky, especially if you've never done it before.. If you want to fix it yourself, watch some YouTube videos of the process of changing the display. Check out ifixit.com for some good resources. This will give you a good idea of how it works and if you think you would be comfortable doing it yourself.

If you just want the data, is it backed up in iTunes or to iCloud?. If its still vibrating most likely the logic board is still ok and you only fry the screen. Plug it into a computer and do a backup. You now have the option of replacing the screen (Usually around 150-250usd from third party repair shop) or cutting your losses and selling the device..

549,Calendar/contacts disappeared - any way to recover?,gov91x,2020-05-23 00:27:54,"All, thanks in advance for any help;

I’ve got an iPhone 6 with 12.4.4. Purchased in 2014 in the US for personal use. 

As of like midnight last night, everything was fine. When I woke up this morning my calendar (I use the Apple default app) was gone and so were almost all of my contacts. 

Things I’ve looked at:

I am still signed in on the iPhone. 

I checked and all the calendars are clicked to show in the app - just now only the holidays have anything. (The other options besides Holidays are Work and Home; not sure what I used before but it was just whatever the default was.)
Checked iCloud, only to discover that my phone wasn’t backing up to iCloud :(

Things I have not done:

Signed out and back in to my phone (don’t want to lose my safari tabs and I don’t know if they’re part of the backup I did earlier today or if signing out will lost them; concerned that logging out &amp; in will “lock in” the problem). 

There is also my concern that signing out will apparently delete, like everything? I can restore from a backup, but won’t that just leave me in the position I’m in?

Updated to the newest iOS (also concerned that updating will “lock in” the problem)

Restored from iCloud (apparently my phone hasn’t been backing up to iCloud; yay)

Things I’m not sure about:

My most recent backup was from 2/1 - is there any way to restore just the calendar and contacts from that backup, or is it an all or nothing thing?

Thanks again!

ETA: Since this happened, I just tried to add something to my calendar and noticed that it picks “Work” as default. I’m all but positive that wasn’t the case before.

Are you using any sync services?. If you have viber/whatsapp & the likes, some contacts could still be saved.

And if you allowed IG to sync contacts, you may retrieve some contacts also.

Now lesson learned here is you might want to sync your contacts with your google email for future use.. Not that I am aware of. I only have a gmail acct and a hotmail account I use for junk mail - I checked both and nothing from my Calendar app was there. I then deleted and re-added my gmail and Hotmail accounts just in case, and that didn’t change anything. 

In that process I discovered that the only things listed on the Calendar app’s accounts are “icloud” and “other” - the Gmail and Hotmail accounts weren’t even listed before I re-added them. Since I wasn’t syncing to icloud, I feel like I must’ve been adding my calendar appts to something else - but what?. May have been only local then... in which case they are lost.

I also wouldn't be surprised if that ends up just being wishful thinking on some analyst's part.. They took away 3D Touch on the SE 2, and with that they took away the Live Photo wallpaper functionality.

Depends on how you use and charge it. 🤷🏻‍♂️. It should be just about pancake batter health. What's expected then for a nearly 3 months old iphone X battery ?. It depends on how you use it, what kind of temperatures it's exposed to regularly, and how often you recharge it. It can be anything from 100% to even as ""bad"" as the mid to low 90s for extremely heavy users who also seem to be careless and do things like leave the iPhone sitting in the sun with the display-side up (it's black... not good).

Some people go several months at 100% because they're light users. I'm definitely in that category. I've had my iPhone 11 since December 12th and it's still at 100% Maximum Capacity. I usually need to recharge once every 3-5 days. I'm serious.. Mild UK temperature so a nice temperature. 

Recharged at night. 

Also is it healthy to charge the phone regularly? Any tips regarding charging to get best usage is appreciated. No. You can just enjoy the iPhone and recharge as needed. To 100%...

My iPhone X is currently caught in a boot loop. I bought it off a friend the other day who told me it was caught in the loop, but I bought it hoping to fix it.

I tried restoring it in both regular restore mode, and even DFU mode but I got the same result both times.

What happens is, it after I run the restores, they appear to complete like normal. When I try to start the phone, or it attempts to boot afterwords, then it shows the apple logo for a few moments; from there it quickly shows an image of the apple logo + the loading bar graphic, then instantly shuts off / restarts after showing a minimal amount of progress on the loading bar.

Yesterday, when I was getting out of the car, the phone fell out of my lap and hit the ground softly in its case, and did no damage to the phone, but it then randomly booted up properly and allowed me to setup the phone.

Today, the phone died and now its caught in the same boot loop as before. Any ideas? I've tried smacking it around a bit but no luck so far. I'm also currently trying to restore it again.

Does the building have signal, and does she have access to his location via a tracking app (like “Find”)?. No beacons installed. I figured she made his iPhone a beacon.

583,"The more photos I delete, the more space “system” takes up.",gnkc9w,2020-05-20 22:02:38,I’ve probably deleted thousands of photos but have only been able to take a few hundred more. I turned on icloud photos but still used all the icloud space up again despite my phone saying I have tons of free storage. What gives? Is it just taking a long time to delete all the photos i deleted or are there fragments of data still leftover?,3,0.81,22.0,"Make sure you delete them from the deleted folder.. Can you post a screenshot of iPhone storage, and how much are System and Other?. If you go to Settings > your name > Photos, turn off iCloud Photos, and tap ""Delete From iPhone"" (they original full resolution images will remain on iCloud).  The ""System"" storage will return to normal.. they skip the deleted folder and delete immediately because my icloud is also full. definitely! i can post when i get home. i’ll try that once i have enough space, currently there would be no where for the photos because my system storage and icloud are both full. even before i turned on icloud storage, “system” was using about half of my storage

edit: i’ve turned icloud on and off a few times so maybe that has something to do with it?. If the photos are stored in your iCloud then deleting them will not clear up space on your phone. 

You should do a backup of your phone, restore it in recovery mode to factory, and then restore your backup. Usually helps with that issue.. Shoot. I don’t know. I finally had to offload some photos because they were taking do much space. I did realize I had been taking my photos with the Live feature and it took a ton of space.. Why wait?. Yes.  When you initially turn iCloud Photos on (or on again), the iOS will compare what is already on the phone and on iCloud (to keep from having duplicates).  It is common to see fluctuation in the amount of storage being used by Photos and System until the sync has completed.  And, if you don't have the space needed on iCloud for the syncing, it will stay in limbo.. If you select the option for ""Optimize iPhone Storage"", a smaller device size copy of the images is made to keep on the phone, so it does take bit extra local phone storage until the first syncing is complete.

50 GB of iCloud storage is just $0.99 per month.  I learned the hard way, sadly, that having my photos backed up is worth 99 cents a month.. i was driving and need to download imgur but gotta clear up some space before i can download imgur lmao. If it’s as bad as a think it is, you may not be able to if you don’t already have it installed.

In that case, you can take a photo with another device and use that.. [here’s a screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/uR0DSY1) 

Note: Even though it says I have about 21GB free on here, it keeps telling me my iphone storage is full. But this is because yesterday I turned on icloud storage to reduce file sizes. Before i did this, “system” was the same but “photos” took up the other 20-ish gigabytes (which i believe it still is doing, it just doesn’t say because they’re supposed to be in my icloud. 

I only have about 6-7000 photos at the moment, before “system” took up all this space my phone could hold about 12,000 photos. It seems that the more i delete photos, the more “system” takes up, so I’m afraid it might be corrupted data or corrupt storage (from filling it up and deleting over and over so many times). How much iCloud storage do you have?. only 5 GB, that’s why it won’t complete the backup. but before i turned on icloud storage, system already took up all that space. Worse.  iCloud Photo Library will continue to eat up local storage as you try to clear things up.

Best bet is to pay for enough iCloud storage to hold your current photo library and allow the sync to complete.. thank you! i might try to cancel the backup if it lets me clear up 5 GB. i wonder if all the “system” storage was because of last time i had icloud turned on, so i might just end up where i started. You’re not the first to have this issue.

Basically, if you don’t have enough iCloud storage to hold your photo library, don’t enable iCloud Photo Library.

People have lost data due to this.

iOS is to busy trying to fit your ‘20-ish’ GB photo library into the 5Gb iCloud storage you get for free... it’s never gonna work.. i think it will let me stop the process right now, but it has to delete 1,300 photos in order to do so, is there any way to see which photos will be deleted before i do it?. From memory, no.

So long as you have your photos backed up somewhere else you can reimport them if it completes successfully.. i didn’t lose any photos after all! system storage is going down more everytime i refresh. thank you for your help!",799.0,11,65,0

However, I bought this phone second-hand simply for using while exercising due to its convenient size. So it will be powered down 97% of the time and I can manage with the screen being on the whole time the other 3%.

What is highly inconvenient is that even while powered down, when the phone receives input that the top button is being pressed, the screen flashes on with the apple logo on for \~5 seconds/off \~5 seconds. This drains the battery pretty quickly even though it's powered down.

Hitting the home button sometimes takes a screenshot. The top button will not sleep the screen because it always immediately wakes back up (though inactivity will permit the screen to sleep)..

- iPhone model and iOS version

iPhone 8 64GB Grey, iOS 13.4.1

- Purchase date, country and nature of purchase

I'm almost certain the phone is no longer under warranty, and if the problem is so dire that it would require repair/replacement beyond what I am able to do myself, I'll just buy a new one. So I wouldn't dwell on this.

- What is the issue, how often does it occur and how to replicate it?

The issue is as follows; when using the Phone app to make a call, I can hear whoever I am calling just fine, but they are unable to hear me. They are able to hear me when I plug in headphones, or use the speaker phone, but not when I hold the phone to my ear. The problem started yesterday and has been replicated on every call I've made since, regardless of the app used. (e.g. Facebook Messenger).

- What caused the issue?

Unknown.

- What did you try to resolve the issue and what was the result?

I have tested the microphone in the voice memo's app and it picks up sound fine. I reset the network settings on the phone as well as the general settings. I did a soft reset on the phone. I've turned off Bluetooth. I have cleaned the lightning port to the best of my ability. I have turned off noise canceling in accessibility.

- Any other information you think might be useful.

The problem seemed to spring up out of no where. I haven't made any software updates or anything that might have acted as a catalyst I don't think. The strangest thing to me is that the headphones and speaker phone will both transmit audio, but not the standard mic. Furthermore, it's strange to me that the standard mic can detect sound in the voice memos app, but will not send it out over any kind of call.

Thanks very much, any help is appreciated. I'll be monitoring this closely and trying anything suggested.

hit the paintbrush icon on top, click the 'arrange' option tab

You want to remove the iPhone from your [Apple ID](appleid.apple.com) , and turn Find My iPhone off for it (in the Find My app on another device signed in to that Apple ID).. Third for iOS reinstall in DFU mode if you are overparanoid (DFU, not Recovery!!!). In other cases factory reset is more than enough, if you're not a celebrity or US senate member ;). DFU mode treats the onboard storage as blank (since it doesn’t understand encryption).  So installing a new iOS image effectively renders the old data irretrievable..

These include the Optimize iPhone Storage and Most Compatible settings. When I look at the resolution of my photos, I see they are all 3088x2320 (this is for the FaceTime camera which is reportedly 7 MP) and take about 1-1.5 MB for JPEG and roughly half that for HEIC photos. If I view the photos on my 1920x1080 monitor they start to get grainy. I don't think this is an issue with transferring the photos to my computer, because I don't have to zoom in too far on my phone before the picture is relatively blurry.

Am I wrong in thinking that a photo should never start to get grainy util the photo is smaller than the screen it is being displayed on?

It used to be called „restriction code“. Maybe someone pranked you? 

If you have your contacts/messages/pictures etc stored on iCloud they will reappear once you sign in with your Apple ID. You just have to redo your settings, download apps, enter passwords for your mail accounts and stuff like that.

639,iPhone 8 [13.1.1] : Messages defaulting to iMessage for Android SMS recipient.,glg4x1,2020-05-17 14:18:47,"Thanks in advance for anyone that can help.

The recipient has a Mac with usage of the iMessage platform and an Android phone.
The messages tend to default to iMessage despite the selected phone number being Android.

If I have sent an iMessage to the recipient earlier in the day and then I want to send a text message, even though I select the mobile number (rather than the associated iMessage email address) it defaults to blue text in the ‘To’ section.

Even if I go ‘new message’ and type in the Android phone number manually, it still defaults to blue. Copy and pasting makes no difference either. 

If I hard press and ‘forward’ the message after it defaults to iMessage, it’s usually the same issue. I don’t think I’ve seen a ‘send as SMS’ option pop up. 

If I go to the contacts and find the person, go ‘message’ and then ‘mobile’ or select their number, it will still set the ‘To’ text to blue/iMessage.

Even if they SMS me, and I try to reply straight back, it will tend to default to whatever I had used to message THEM last, and if it’s an iMessage to their Mac, it almost creates a cycle. I hope that makes sense?

It’s been doing this for some time, and is variable/intermittent with no pattern, despite undertaking the last few iOS update, restarting the phone, restating the messages app and turning iMessages on and off. 

Is anyone else struggling with this? I suppose it’s probably something technical, but it can be really irritating if you’re trying to contact someone with something important and they don’t see the message straight away, because it will be sitting in their email inbox instead, if their Mac isn’t open!

Side note: I feel like I can still select numbers fine through my Mac, so I hope it’s not some weird communication issue between my iPhone and Mac. I have got messages synced with iCloud too, if that would be make any difference to the issue.

I recently bought a Samsung Fit e fitness band. I downloaded the Samsung Health app and paired it with the Fit e. The thing is, I desperately need the Samsung Health and Apple Health apps to sync with one another on the heart rate and step counter data. The reason being that my health insurer app will only allow the Apple Health app to give it data.

Just not the Samsung health app for some reason.

But for some reason, Apple Health will only use iPhone as a source of data and not the Fit e band or the Samsung Health app. I can only give permission for the Samsung Health app to read data from Apple Health and not write as well.

The home button itself is still working (e.g. bringing up Siri, unlocking phone, going back home, etc.), however I don’t seem to be getting the vibration that comes with a normal press of the iPhone 7 home button. The closest thing to a vibration that I’m getting is a small distorted squishy sound resembling its click when I press home.

Is this something to wait out? I mean it was only under (cool) water for like 8 secs max. I had the bottom grills facing downwards the entire time (so water wasn’t directly pouring into any of the bottom ports/grills). Isn’t iPhone 7 water resistant (IP67)?

The water pressure from the faucet can physically misplace the internals. Treat water resistance as a safety net. It's only meant to protect against splashes and a quick submerge in shallow water.. All you can do at this point is wait and hope as it dries it starts to work again. You definitely didn’t follow Apple’s suggested method for cleaning your phone. You can find more info here:

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207123. Turn the device off, leave it in a well ventilated area for several hours and cross your fingers.

Edit: if you don’t have a current backup, make sure to do that first.. Wow, I had no idea faucet pressure could do such a thing. Noted!

That definitely sounds like a great policy — treat water resistance as a safety net, and don’t actively test your device against water (although I was really just trying to clean my device in worry that it got contaminated by COVID-19 while out shopping). Regardless, I took a risk (didn’t want to clean the alcohol odour off my hands after such an approach, and I was already right at the sink where there was conveniently soap and water 😬) and it looks like it went badly. I’m hoping it comes around though. So far I’ve waited around 18 hours for any remaining liquid to evaporate (although I’ve been using my device during that time and it wasn’t completely turned off and left alone), and the haptic feedback/vibration still hasn’t returned. Audio is just fine though.

Thank you for all your input.. I really hope it dries out. I was puzzled though — isn’t iPhone 7 water resistant? If so, why does that page say getting moisture in its openings is a really bad thing?. Because water resistant doesn't equal water proof.. No, it isn’t.

Water resistance tends to fade with age and use on models that are water resistant.. Well, I wasn’t really expecting waterproofing (it was just pouring tap water and not submersion). I was just hoping water resistance could mitigate my situation. I mean it’s not like I had the phone completely submerged in a liquid.

At the same time, I do understand it’s better not to have the device in contact with water in any case, if given the choice. I’d just taken a risk out of convenience, since I’d already been at a sink in my bathroom where there was soap and water right nearby. I’d figured IP67 should mean it wouldn’t be that bad, and I guess it didn’t work out. I’m still waiting and hoping though (albeit in the dark for now).

Thanks for your post!. Yeah, the seal fades over time, and a lot of times if you’ve ever had work done to a phone the water resistance is destroyed in the process of opening the device.. Well, I hope I lucked out in that case. I did have its battery replaced in Oct. 2018 (at the Apple store), and I hope when resealing the phone Apple had renewed the seals. 🤞🏻. But wouldn’t new sealing be applied by Apple when they’re closing the device? I actually had my battery replaced in Oct. 2018 at the Apple store.. That was a while ago.

Even if it turns back on, make sure to keep up to date backups as water damage can take a while before it actually affects anything.. That was a year and a half ago... more than enough time for the new seals to wear out again.. Didn’t know that! You mean it could actually stop working completely in like, say, 1.5 weeks from now? Sounds like a backup would be a smart thing to do.. And oddly enough, I had Apple support conduct a diagnostics test on my device via the app. They said the test results showed nothing was wrong internally with my device. I’m not really sure if that matters towards anything though.. Ah, I see. Well, I guess this just has to be waited out.. Could be a few days, could be never 🤷🏻‍♂️. Not at all.

Hello sub, this is my first post here I was hoping to get some insight on a problem I’m having with my IPhone XR.

The volume up button does not make that tactile clicking noise anymore and feel mushy to press through my case and without it. The other button does not have this problem at all, what solutions should I try to fix it? Thank you for your responses!",1,1.0,3.0,"The button itself might have be dirty or damaged.  Not much you can do without opening it up.. Shut down your iPhone. Don't do any of this until it is completely powered off.

Fold up a paper towel into a tiny square, soak it with water, squeeze out some of the water but not all of it. Maybe leave about half the amount of water in it. You want this little square to be like a soaked sponge that is holding water but not dripping wet.

Orient your iPhone so that volume buttons are on top.

Now, use this paper towel ""sponge"" to squeeze out the remaining water over the buttons repeatedly by pressing the paper towel square ""sponge"" against the buttons.. You're rinsing out whatever has made the button become sticky/mushy. It's ok to press the buttons with the paper towel. In fact, I recommend it.

Do not run the iPhone under water as an alternative way to do this. I repeat: do not do it. This paper towel method is far safer. Yes, it's still risky, but if your Xr has no defects, the water you repeatedly squeeze out shouldn't go inside.

Do this a few times. By that, I mean, get more water into your little paper towel ""sponge"", squeeze maybe half of it out and then press it against the buttons again to try to rinse out whatever is in there.

When you've done it maybe 2-3 times altogether, you should use a dry paper towel to press the buttons and you should blow very hard around the entire circumference of the buttons to further help get the water out of there.

Now, test the buttons. If they are both clicky again, you may turn the iPhone back on. If this didn't solve the problem at all, then, well of course you can turn the iPhone back on but I would take it to an Apple store and have them look at it.

I have an iPhone 11 and I had a lemonade spill near my iPhone and some of it splashed against the Sleep/Wake button. A few hours later, my Sleep/Wake button lost its clicky feel and sound and it would stick as well. I did exactly as I described above and it restored it 100%.. Damn. That’s a bummer.

Every time I type in “S” as the starting letter it locks and I have to close and open, close and open. 

Did the simple stuff like reboot the phone, and went into web data and started deleting any sites starting with “S” that had any actual data next to it (as opposed to 0.0mb). 

I can type every other letter of the alphabet except for “S”. I’m not sure when this started because the last few days I’ve most stuck to my favorites. 

I’m sure the simplest answer is to clear history and web data. But I’d like to avoid that. 

I can, however, start with “www.s” and get to the site. Also, I’ve got no issues starting with S in my Firefox browser. 

I’m totally perplexed by this. Like I said, clearing all history and web data is the obvious place to start but I’d like to avoid that.

705,iPhone 11 Pro dead,giki49,2020-05-12 21:10:51,"So my mom dropped her iPhone 11 one to many times.... now the phone only powers on but can’t be unlocked or backed up to a computer. The LCD screen shows a display but has zero function.  She wants to keep all of the information and transfer it to a new iPhone via iCloud but I can’t grant access to my computer via the phone because it needs to be unlocked, also Apple doesn’t offer an option to backup a phone online via iCloud. 

I’ve called Apple, local places around that fix phones, and our service provider. They all have given me the same answer “we can get you a new phone” or “we can’t repair it”. I’m wondering if anyone else has ran into this problem and if so what did you do to either fix the phone, transfer the data, or back up the information to put it onto a new phone. Thanks!",1,1.0,14.0,"When you say the screen “shows a display but has zero function”, what does that mean? You can see the full image on the screen but can’t interact with it? Or you can’t see anything but garbage on the screen but at least it lights up? How do you know the phone is working otherwise, if you call the number does it ring?

If the phone is actually functional except for the screen, you may have some options. If the touchscreen is working at all, you can try to type in the passcode blind by sort of guessing where the numbers are. This might get you to be able to back it up with itunes. Another potential option is using a USB keyboard via an adapter to type in the passcode.. Let me clarify: 
1. “Shows a display but has zero function” meaning I can see the full image on the screen but can’t interact with it. 

2. When I call the phone it does ring, but other than that the touch screen is completely unresponsive.

If I used an adapter for lightning cable to USB and connected a USB keyboard, if I pressed enter could that potentially prompt the passcode entry on the screen? Allowing me to type in the code unlocking the phone? 

With a fully functioning phone, except screen, is it possible to repair the screen? Everyone I called doesn’t have the parts.. That is recommended, and also the getting a mouse connected too.. Okay, thank you! I will try that. Also, if you have a Windows computer you can use 3uTools to transfer all of the data over to the new iPhone.. Okay I do, I’ll look into that tonight. You will have to trust the computer though, but 3uTools might be able to recognize it anyways.. Alright so I may be able to skip the “trust this computer” step if the software identifies it?. Maybe, but it’s still recommended to try using a mouse and keyboard if possible to get into the iPhone and trust the computer.. If you have plugged the iPhone into the computer in question before and you already trusted it it will work.. Alright I’ll try that first. Thank you! I find it funny that not one of these places I called recommended trying this smh. Oh okay, unfortunately this is the first time it will ever be plugged into a computer, my mother has no access to one.

711,Restoring as much as possible to new iPhone with new Apple ID,gic3t2,2020-05-12 14:20:36,"I am getting a new iPhone. The iPhone is backed up so I had thought it would have been as simple as plugging the new iPhone in, restoring from backup and swapping out the SIM card. 

Unfortunately, for reasons too complex to get into here, the new iPhone must have a new Apple ID and I can't simply restore from backup. To what extent and how, after I get this new iPhone can I move as much as possible from my old iPhone/backup? I have done some googling and it seems that I can log in to the app store with my old Apple ID - but do I have to restore all the apps individually? 

Thanks!",5,1.0,14.0,"At your initial setup of the new phone, must you login with the new Apple ID or can you do it at a later stage?. When you are setting up your new phone, it should have an option to wirelessly transfer all your data from your old phone. If you have already set up your new phone but are not satisfied, you can erase the data and start again.. It’s a pain in the ass but you need to setup family sharing and then you can work 2 I cloud instanced on your new phone.. I will need to log in with the new Apple ID at the initial setup.. But this would require you to login to old Apple ID which is something OP cannot do it seems.. Thank you - will that process work when the new iPhone will have a new Apple ID?. Guess it’s pretty much start a new for ya.. Is there anyway you can start with your original Apple ID and change it after transfer? 

You will have to enter your old apple ID while they are transfering, for security reasons. This also applies to wallets/private things. Other than that, the rest of your apps, history and downloads will transfer. After the transfer is complete you can change your apple ID.. This happens before you have the option to use a new ID. And it will log in to the old iD. You can then log out and log in to the new ID. 

Have you forgotten the credentials for the old ID?  Why are you so hesitant to use it, if only temporarily?. Thank you! It will be someone else doing the transfer. So could they do the transfer with all the apps/history/etc. and then change the Apple ID and install anything new that they want? Would that delete anything?. It's not hesitance per se - essentially, I'll be given the new phone with a new Apple ID already pre-loaded.. I don't think it would delete anything, except some of the data on the apps, which would not work anyway on a new apple ID.  As long as you know your old apple ID it should be good.. You’ll have to remove it and wipe the phone in order to migrate your data.

My last backup was from about a year ago on my old phone.

My 11's memory was full and I've been backing up videos slowly to dropbox. I was trying to delete stuff to clear out the memory yesterday morning but it wasn't responding so I tried to restart it, this sent it into a boot loop. Tried all the tricks to get it out but it would only stop while I was holding the power button after force restart (spent all day doing this).

A message came up on the screen to connect to a computer and gave the link to [support.apple](https://support.apple). something or other so I followed it. Went to itunes and it said it would download the latest ios and try to fix it, but that if that didn't work I would need to do a factory reset, clicked okay and it went straight into a factory reset but I didn't realise what it was doing (it said it was 'restoring' and my stupid ass thought it was restoring ios).

In a panic I set it to load the last backup I had which turned out to be the one from over a year ago.

Is there anything I can do to recover my original files?

got the new screen put on and trying to plug it into my computer and nothing is coming up on itunes or anything. Is hard reset basically my only option here?

checked the charging cable to make sure it isnt a dud; however ive never backed up or used itunes on this computer",1,1.0,15.0,"So because the display was replaced, it’s very likely the screen isn’t calibrated with the phone. Because it’s disabled, the phone wants you to connect it to iTunes in order to restore it (erase it to factory settings). 

[These are the steps you want to follow.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263) 

Now I’m not sure how well the display will respond to touch after the restore is complete because it’s a third party screen that’s not calibrated.. As long as it was even a halfway decent quality screen, calibration should be a non-issue. But yes, OP likely needs to go into restore mode to get iTunes to recognize the phone because the password was entered incorrectly too many times.. The only reason I say that is because it sounds like the display isn’t communicating properly with the device. I just wanna set up proper expectations for them because I can’t guarantee that this well worth, y’know?. It sounds like the digitizer layer got damaged and was “ghost touching” which kicked him out before the screen was replaced. Now the screen is working but won’t connect to iTunes as it is. That’s what his question was about. 

Recovery mode to update is pretty much his option and hope it doesn’t force him to restore.. If it’s disabled I don’t think an update will resolve the issue.. Connecting to iTunes in restore mode and updating can certainly kick it out of the permanently disabled mode. I did it to an iPhone 7+ earlier today. It will force it back to the iPhone is disabled for 60 minutes screen and after the countdown you can get back in.. Hey could you help me out please? I would greatly appreciate it, dealing with a very similar situation! Let me know, thank you. I have an iPhone SE that is ‘disabled - connect to iTunes’ how do I get it to update via iTunes on a computer which it was previously synced with (not a very recent backup) which is why I don’t want to restore. The one problem I am encountering is getting it to update when connected to iTunes. Any feedback or help would definitely be very much appreciated. Thank you :). Is iTunes recognizing the phone? Has it tried to update but given you an error?. It recognizes the iPhone when I put hold home&power then release power during load up screen. Then when I click update instead of restore to prevent from losing data it doesn’t move past “contacting iPhone update server”. Thanks for the reply, much appreciated. No error was given but it seems to be stuck during update, any advice?. Not really, if it’s getting stuck on a particular part of the update cycle, I usually tell the people to contact Apple or try the restore if they have backed up recently.. Would you happen to know if it has anything to do with ‘Find My iPhone’ being enabled on the device?. It shouldn’t. Whether FMI is on or off, the phone still needs to check with the server to view the status.. Last question, is it possible to fix by putting the device into lost mode via iCloud?

For this to make more sense we need to understand a little fundamental about how iOS works.
Each app is in its own sandbox. This is every app, like even the system apps like Photos and Music. No app can have access unless it is done through the system or explicitly permitted. Even as far as I know, the Files app is it’s own sandbox.
Now, iTunes (or any app like AnyTrans that is able to pretend to be iTunes) has access to a few of these sandboxes, like Photos, contacts, Music, etc. So the way you can add music to your phone is through those programs. They will not reside in your files, they will reside in Music’s sandbox.
You can use iTunes or an alternative.
The way “music player” apps get access to that music is that they prompt you to allow them to communicate with Music’s sandbox.
Hope this made a few things more clear.. I use the Music app.

Add MP3 to the Music app on Mac

Sync music library to iPhone.. Like something to manage all my mp3 files on my phone, instead of using just, “Files.”. The whole security and architecture of iOS is quite stunning and robust.

seemingly nothing. I have not dropped it or got water on it. It pretty much just sits on my couch next to me during all this. I live alone so its not like I have a kid that messed with it and isn't telling me.

It seems like a really good idea and has a lot of potential but it’s just horse shit.

I was literally just using the mail app - which I use around ten times a day - and i didn’t even close it down when switching to another app, and thats when it happened. I jumped back to the homescreen, everything was fine, I swiped right to another set of apps and swiped back (habit) and my iPhone suddenly decided that I don’t need the mail app which is one of my most used apps, and starts to offload it while it was still open in the background. What the fuck?! Not only that, but it also started offloading the calculator app and the contacts app, both of which i also use a lot and both of which could be essential in an emergency.

None of those apps take up much space and yet I still have a selection of games that I havent touched in months and take up gigabytes of data that haven’t been offloaded ever.

When the auto brightness increases the brightness, the slider in CC also moves up. You can change the brightness manually, but AB might change it.. There’s sensor on your iphone.

Maybe I should be starting a new post for this other question but you might be able to answer for me it’s a pretty quick question. When I got my XS, I did the Quickstart transfer from my 6S. Does that mean that all of the previous update data from all of the system updates I did on the 6S would also get transferred to my XS? Taking up unnecessary space?

766,what is the oldest ios version that still supports downloading apps from the app store ?,ggej4d,2020-05-09 12:21:52,what is the oldest ios version that still supports downloading apps from the app store ?,3,1.0,8.0,"They all do if you have had the app installed in the past. Doesn’t it also depends if the app supports the iOS version?. let me rephrase it 

at what point will apple not allow me to access the store because my ios version is too old ?. Lowest device I have iOS iOS 4 which lets me last I checked. I resell iPhones. But is pretty sure it’s because I have had apps downloaded before. So if you never downloaded apps at the time of iOS 4 or 6 etc etc then they prob won’t. Any iPhone that supports downloading apps will always support downloading apps, as for what iphone model first provided access to the App Store, I’m pretty sure it was the iphone 3rd gen.  the problem isn’t with what model of iPhone supports downloading apps, itcomes in with whether or not the apps support the software and hardware version of your iPhone. App developers are who dictate what apps are available in the store, what devices those apps support, and what software those apps will work on. It’s why there are some apps that are available on the iPhone that aren’t available on the iPad even if they run the same up to date iOS version.. so the 3rd gen iphone to this day has the ability to search the app store ?

another question .most apps on android target android 4.4.4 .

on IOS what is generally the most targeted version ?. Latest ofc. Some apps do have latest compatible version available for the last compatible iOS version on the device, but not all of them.. I would assume the third version supports the App Store, I didn’t get into iPhones until the 4th gen.... as for which apps work with which versions.... there really isn’t a way to determine that.... it’s all app developer specific. One app development company may have multiple apps that do different things, and because those apps do different things, hardware and security feature  requirements may be different, so dictates which version of iOS is supported.

For example, an app that supports a form of payment method would have different security requirements than say a game application. So the game application MAY be able to be run on a lower software/device version than the payment application, even though they are created by the same developer. 

It also comes down to who the app was written for. Devices get replaced and upgraded, so you see far more iPhone 8’s than you do iPhone 5’s. Would you spend money supporting a device/software that is only used by a small fraction of users, or would you concentrate on devises/software that has a larger user base? If you make money supporting the larger user base, but loose money on the smaller user base, it becomes an easy choice for the developers.",476.0,16,16,0

That’s interesting, the 3D Touch component is built into the display (behind the LCD) on the iPhone 8. If Apple simply reused the iPhone 8 with a new chipset on the board the 3D Touch sensor should still be in the device. I guess it’s most likely it has been disabled at the software level for continuities sake. I understand the reasoning from a brand perspective but it seems kind of a shame for the device to include the component and not allow the user the option to make use of it if they preferred..

I received a business phone which is a lot better than my personal phone, I would like to use it primarily while still keeping my personal phone on the side but without carrying it around.

I was wondering if there’s a way I can forward all calls/messages sent to my personal phone over to my business phone? 

And also would there be a way for my responses/history to be forwarded back to my personal phone as well if I responded from my business phone? In a sync kind of fashion, would this just be done via iCloud? 

Overall, this is more of functional thing and I’m just looking at my options to roll this out. Both phones are in a plan and I’m not sure my company will let me swap my personal number over or add a dual/e sim, so I’m limited to using an app to do this. 

Any help would be really appreciated, thank you in advance!",5,1.0,10.0,"If you have a 2018/19 iPhone you can use esim for one for them and put both sims in one phone

This may be easier than call forwarding. If both phones are iPhones you can sync call history. On your personal phone go to settings>phone>call forwarding. I’ve never used it, but I assume the feature works like it should. It might be carrier dependent. Test it out and report back. 

For messages you’ve got two things going on. I’m not sure about regular SMS messages and how they can be forwarded. But for iMessages (iPhone to iPhone) they can be received easily by having both numbers associated with your iCloud account. Go to settings>messages>send and receive and check both numbers.. Maybe using google voice with call forwarding?. Ummm you can actually have them linked up and say if phone 

A  is work and b is old phone 
You go on setting then phone and click near by devices and turn on and for iMessage you can click both numbers to come to that phone must be on same iCloud I did this before. >I was wondering if there’s a way I can forward all calls/messages sent to my personal phone over to my business phone?

If they're both iPhones, and your personal/work numbers are on carriers that allow WiFi calling, then you should be able to have both numbers sync up on both phones,  by signing into your iCloud account on both. If you do this and the turn on [Messages in the Cloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208532), then all your Apple devices should have access to your messages from both phone numbers.

I’m a student and recently got the new SE after saving up for a while and I absolutely love it so far.

785,iPhone 6s does not appear in iTunes when plugged into my computer (Trust prompt appears),gfl9jw,2020-05-08 03:10:22,"Trying to backup/sync my phone before I send in the 6s for trade-in per the instructions on the Apple website. I transferred all data to my new iPhone SE already with the proximity option when I booted the phone for the first time.

&#x200B;

When I plug the iPhone into my computer, Windows makes a sound and my phone asks me if I want to trust this computer. I click Allow and then nothing happens. The iPhone appears as a device in my Windows explorer, but not in iTunes. 

&#x200B;

Both the iPhone and iTunes are on the most recent versions. I have tried multiple lightning cables and have rebooted multiple times. Outside of uninstalling iTunes, I'm not sure what else to do. 

&#x200B;

Is it absolutely necessary I backup/sync my phone if I already did a direct transfer to my new iPhone SE? If it is not, can I just sign out and wipe my iPhone 6s and mail it into Apple so I can get trade-in credit?

&#x200B;

Thank you!",1,1.0,10.0,"I’d suggest a back up, just in case something goes wrong with the new phone, but if you have the data transferred to the new phone already, it’s not necessary. You can sign out of iCloud, then erase all content and settings to fully erase it and send it back. 

You could back up to iCloud to avoid messing with iTunes, or you could mess
With the computer and iTunes to get it working. The computer issue could be a cable issue, USB port issue, iTunes issue, driver issue (the most likely cause with windows), or a security software issue. If it won't appear in iTunes just reinstall iTunes, it takes like 10 minutes. Also make sure to check all steps from related article: [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204095](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204095)

p.s. If you had only a part of your photos, are you sure you don't use iCloud Photo Library already? You can check what's saved on [icloud.com](https://icloud.com). https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204095. In your first paragraph do you mean to backup my 6s or the new SE? I assume SE since I can’t get iTunes to recognize my 6S phone. If all data was transferred to the new phone and I back up the SE I’m good to go right?. Thank you.

&#x200B;

I just ended up paying the .99 to get 50gb of storage. I then had every single one of my photos on the old phone upload to iCloud last night. Before I send the phone in I'm going to download all of the photos from iCloud  and create a backup on both of my PC hard drives and an external hard drive.. Really, either, or which ever, since the info is on both. But making sure your data is backed up is always smart.. Ok awesome! Thanks for your help. My old phone has tons of photos of our deceased dogs so it’s really important I do this correctly. Thank you!. No problem, pics and videos are impossible to get back without a backup.... just make sure it’s all on your new phone before erasing anything. Compare the total photos of both.. Interesting, so my old phone has 3,294 photos and 43 videos.

&#x200B;

My new SE only has 506 photos and 13 videos. Is there an easy way to carry every single photo over to the new phone?

&#x200B;

I'm pretty sure most of the photos are saved on my computer and backup drive, but I also want them on the new phone just in case.. iCloud Photo Library is easiest, but will take time, and space. Fastest would be through the computers photo app since the computer sees the phone, iTunes isn’t required to see the phone.

You could also fix the screen yourself. It's not that hard if you follow the instructions.  The lock button though, you may either want to live with, or wait until you can take it to a repair shop. I've been repairing phones professionally for 8 years now, and I still mutter some choice words when a ticket for a lock button comes up.. Thank you for letting me know.. Yeah.

iPhone 7 Plus 32gb. with 25gb iCloud storage. There are about 5 apps on the phone as she has tried to delete them all to save storage. Curretly on iOS 13.2 but cant update the software because of the storage issue.

Both iCloud and phone storage were full so she deleted apps etc photos but after this happened the storage never updated but the apps are gone and then photos would say they are deleted by then re appear shortly after. Her photos take up the most space but no where near the 25gb she could use the cloud to store them in.

Another issue that old photos become blurry and cant be viewed properly. Why is this?I've tried to point her to a few things but havent been able to resolve it. Some apps started to show a cloud with an arrow i think next to them before they were 'deleted'.

I had exactly the same issue. Turns out for some reason we need to take an extra step which wasn't mentioned in the article (perhaps due to different generations of Mac, with different hardware?)

I wanted to save my data though, I don’t want to lose everything. I don’t know what to do.
Do you think there’s some way to remove the jailbreak even though it’s in a boot loop? that way it can actually turn on properly afterwards. Checkrain will not wipe it if you can do that, and there may be another untethered jailbreak for 13.4.1 (there’s an exploit that was found) and if you didn’t want it booted jailbroken, you could just use a verbose boot that was released before the full checkrain was. Other than that I’m out of ideas. So I can jailbreak it even though it’s in a boot loop? Or what do you mean. It’s still on ios9. Well things can’t really get worse from a boot loop, so I would still try checkrain even tho it’s made for iOS 13 because it boots it through a different exploit, not Apples way or however your current jailbreak boots it. As long as it can enter DFU mode you should be ok. And if you verbose boot it will not boot jailbroken(technically it is but you can’t install cydia). Ok thank you, I’ll try it. Is there a link I can get checkrain from? 
& how do I verbose boot, is there a video on YouTube maybe?. Hey, you know how it was in a boot loop, well now it just goes to the recovery screen?(where it says to plug to iTunes) after 5 seconds. That’s worse than being in the boot loop right?. Glad you asked, there are many fake cites to get u to download malware; the real cite is [checkra.in](checkra.in) and yes there are videos on YouTube for all of it. I don’t remember where I got the verbose boot files from but it’s all on youtube(search up something around the lines of “checkm8/checkrain verbose boot exploit”). You are in recovery mode, hold down power button to get it out, then try and enter DFU mode again. Thanks for the help. One more question sorry. So do I need to verbose boot to jailbreak with checkrain?  or is that just a separate thing that does something else?. The verbose boot was release before they had a finalized jailbreak ready for release. It was put out for testing and development purposes. And no the verbose boot thing uses the same exploit, but jailbreaking you use the application, verbose boot it’s a file and you use the terminal. So I found a guide on YouTube for checkrain by iCU, I got to the part where I need to boot it from my usb, but it says ‘blocked by current security policy’. Is that the firewall? Or something else. Because i turned them off but it still didn’t work.. Are you on OS X?. I’m using windows. Omg sorry, you’re using rainusb correct?. It’s ok haha, the program is called bootrain I think. Can you enable booting from USB in your bios? I don’t use windows on a laptop so I don’t know how. On a desktop you can see what all is plugged in and bootable + the base OS on the hard drive/ssd.

I have so many damn pictures and videos on my phone, I dont wanna transfer every damn thing. Just the videos I did.. Great idea, and looks nice, but again, I shouldn't have to pay for a damn app that does what ANY other phone can do out of the box.

Hell, I would even accept something being IN itunes for this.

Syncing EVERYTHING should not be the only option, especially if I have thousands upon thousands of pictures and videos on my phone (for having the largest size available, FOR video recording...)

I appreciate the option and I may have to cave for it, But as of now, I am deeply considering switching back to android..ive had apple since it was released on AT&T only...I've supported their shit for so long and it was even easier back then to get videos and pictures off...

...But the fact that I now have to jump through completely unnecessary hoops, or buy people's software just to do what a phone should simply do out of the box, is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous.

Hope youre listening apple. (i know they aren't). If I only wanted one, I would airdrop it.

If you can’t, you could upload to Dropbox or similar and download on computer.. Came from Nexus and I do feel your pain... Managing files if you don't rely on the cloud is a real pain, they definitely should do it more easy and stop forcing people to use iCloud.

About switching to Android, for me it was more a security update (couldn't wait for Ubuntu Mobile for another 100 years :D ), so using a third-party manager was an option as long as it doesn't require jailbreak and won't violate sandbox. I got iMazing while it was with a \~50% discount for like $20, but actually would pay the full price now without any questions. It gives similar options as on Android in terms of file management, but you still have same security level.. I have a PC...airdrop aint really a thing for me. And if im doing 1080p or 4k video, thats a huge file to send wirelessly...

So in that sense, ANY free cloud based stuff is a no-go.

Why in the absolute SHIT in this so damn hard to do for a windows PC to take a damn video file?

I had a method work previously that I thought I saved from about a year ago i posted, asking for help, but i dunno how to search my history.. > Managing files if you don't rely on the cloud is a real pain, they definitely should do it more easy and stop forcing people to use iCloud.

Its not so much getting them to not use the cloud for everything, I like the idea of sharing stuff between my devices. Honestly, between that and the icloud email addresses, is the only reason I continue to use my iphone...and facetime and walkie talkie on the apple watch.

The big thing that i dont like is that simple fact that when you take pictures or videos, you have to go through holy hell in order to get any of them on your computer at all...and the issue with transferring any of them to icloud then bringing them to your computer that way, causes you to lose a bit of the resolution and stuff...cause like, they advertise good lookin pictures and videos, but if you do THAT, it loses something...

Plus, who the hell wants to sit there for hours (maybe) to download a very large, or multi part 4k video, and risk some kinda transfer issue happening and losing some or all of it during the download?

Not I. Though i suppose the same can be said for a physical transfer as well, but at least then, speeds are a lot faster and less room for error.. Whatever the Windows equivalent of Image Capture then?. Used wrong words I guess. Meant that iCloud is a good solution in most cases, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't maintain local transfer and never update it. I understand that Macs have AirDrop and Image Capture is still alive (at least partially), but what the hell should I do if I need to work with Windows/Linux or just don't want to use a Mac? They basically don't leave any choice if you don't want to spend a lot of time to make it work. Best example -- change backup location. It should take like 30 min to implement the custom path, 2-3 blocks of code, but you need to tinker with symlinks... What exactly should I do by their design if I have a 128GB typewriter and a 1 TB external drive for main stuff?

833,(HELP) Need to Take Low Res Photos,gdsqyi,2020-05-05 06:46:24,"Hi there!

So for work I take tons and tons of photos everyday (500-1000), and my company has a cloud where I upload them, but in order to conserve space I need them to be small files. They prefer 640x480. 

Obviously iPhone natively takes high resolution photos, and aside from changing the photo “compatibility” settings and the video resolution, I haven’t been able to find a way to take 640x480 pics with the camera. 

My last work phone was an android and I had an app that would let me take 640x480 pics, but I haven’t had any luck finding an app like this for iPhone. 

Right now I’m stuck using Microsoft picture manager to resize them after plugging into my computer after a long day of work and doing it manually. It’s a huge pain in the ass, and would save me so much time if I could make them low resolution right from my iPhone, and upload them on the spot using my data. 

Does anybody know of any apps or hidden settings that can help with this?

All input is much appreciated.

838,iPhone photos to Windows 10,gdmcm3,2020-05-04 23:10:54,"I'm having really annoying problems backing up my wife's photo's to my PC. I'm an android user so please bear with me if my knowledge seems stupid. I haven't had an iPhone since the 4 (briefly with the 7 but never plugged it into a PC). My wife has 10'000's of photos and I'd like to put what I can on my PC and eventually into the cloud. I'd do this directly to google cloud but I don't want it running in the background all day, I can schedule this on my PC run in the small hours of the night (bandwidth isn't amazing so i don't want it ruining our internet during the day).

1. It's my understand that iCloud and her phone are fully synced and I cannot have stuff in the cloud but not of the phone?  
If this is the case my aim here is to add them to my google drive, as I believe she can download google photos and view things on her phone and it seems there's workaround to have it delete photos from the phone but not the cloud.
2. First thing I did was plug it into my PC and from memory. It worked like a USB stick for photos. I was simply going to copy and paste them.  
It's only showing me a handful of photos in a handful of folders. 103APPLE, 105APPLE...107,1108 111,117,121,125 and 126. Some are empty, some have a single photo in them and the last one has about 20.   
I tried using photos as per apple's instructions but just see's the above photos.   

3. I previously set up iCloud on my PC to sync with a folder on my PC. It's hasn't synced since January (I know it's been on as I've seen it running on several occasions. 
4. Iit's on now and not doing everything). I ran it not long ago and it's downloading 26,000 items. I suspect I'm getting more duplicate copies of photos. I had previously seen it up to date. It was easy to set up on my C drive but a pain in the ass (and I work in IT) to set up on a secondary drive. Ideally, I don't use iCloud as it's a hunk of shit and I've tried to use it several times over the years and is by far the most troublesome program I've ever had to deal with (and I have many clients that use all sorts of weird and wonderful programs).

When iCloud photos is turned on, all photos are uploaded to iCloud and a small thumbnail is displayed on the device. When you click on a picture it downloads it to show the full res version. It does this to save space when you have the option to “Optimize iPhone Storage” selected. 

The easiest way to get a copy of all of the photos in iCloud is to use iCloud for Windows and download them as I believe you said you are doing. 

Alternative method would be to turn off iCloud Photos on the phone, tell it to download and keep originals, and then copy them from the folders on the phone as you used to. I imagine this may not be an option with the number of photos you are trying to copy.. The hell that is ""optimize""

*sigh*. So regarding getting it off the phone. This makes sense. But why are there the odd photo here or there? There a block of somewhat recent photos from January in there and nothing since. I would assume it's videos and photos we have looked at recent at which is downloaded to view but it isn't that. Anyway, yes it's too much so it won't work.

iCloud is now my issue. All the dupes and nothing downloaded in months. I thought screw it, I can just redownload everything. I tried changing the folder to it went to to start over but iCloud was in the middle of an update (it wasn't as it happened after 2 restarts and I had already updated).

So I uninstalled and reinstalled. Now it's missing the option to download photos and videos. Just upload photos or download shared folders. Turned in the iCloud option and that works fine though. It was 2am and that's when I gave up.. I think if you hold down Shift, or Ctrl, or Alt when clicking the tray icon for iCloud you will get the download all photos option again.

Every time I power off and power back on, the phone requires either a passcode or face unlock. Is there a way to disable authentication locking at for 2 minutes so that if I quickly power off/on my phone, it takes me directly into the phone?",2,0.67,6.0,"No, that defeats the purpose of having a passcode/face ID.  If you don't want to have that, you can disable those security features. Yes, but you will still have to swipe up to to the Home screen. Just do this:

1. Go to **Settings > Face ID & Passcode**
2. Turn off ""iPhone Unlock"" (sorry, this is required if you want to get the results you're after!) It will take a moment and then it will turn off the setting. You'll feel haptic feedback when the setting gets set.
3. Scroll down to ""Require Passcode""
4. Go into it and choose the time you want (your only option would be ""Immediately"" if ""iPhone Unlock"" is on). It takes a moment to change the setting. You won't feel any haptic feedback.

So let's say you choose 2 minutes. If you put your iPhone into sleep mode and you wake it up 1 minute and 59 seconds later, it'll still be unlocked. Since it's a Face ID iPhone though, you will still have to swipe up. That's something that can't be changed.

**Purchase Date/Location and Use:**  October 2019 from the apple website in the US for personal use

**The Problem:** When I receive a text message/iMessage notification while my screen it locked, the screen does not wake, does not vibrate, and there is no ding/vibration when in ringer mode either. I do not have these problems if the screen is awake and locked or awake and unlocked. Occasionally the notifications will work properly immediately after locking my phone, but majority of the time, the notification simply doesn't work.

851,HEIC images taken on iPhone X are larger than Apple's Image Capture exports,gcvtr1,2020-05-03 18:45:26,"TL;DR: Image Capture on the Mac is exporting HEIC images smaller than they were stored on the iPhone. Am I losing photo quality here and if so how do I transfer my iPhone's photos exactly as they are saved on the device?

Full Details: 

To make use of all the time we've got right now as a result of the quarantine, I've been collecting all my photos from various different devices over the years and storing them in one location ready to upload to the cloud.  

Although I had my fair share of issues with some Android phones, trying to get the photos off my iPhone X onto a Windows PC has been nothing short of a nightmare. I won't go into it too much here but I want to upload these photos into the cloud as JPG's not HEIC's, however, iOS's automatic conversion feature does not work at all and crashes everytime I try to move the folders over. I also get the same result when I turn on the 'Keep Originals' option. 

After much frustration, I've decided to use the Image Capture application on my Macbook Air to just move the entire library over to a USB as HEIC's. Then I'll find a good converter to change them into JPG's. When I compare the exported file on my USB to the exif data of the exact same photo on my iPhone X though, I'm noticing massive size differences. Often entire megabytes... 

I want these transferred photos to be the same quality as they are on the phone itself. That's why I haven't used any 3rd party transfer tools, to avoid a loss in quality. Image Capture seems to be doing this anyway though.

Any help or any other solution so I can transfer my photos easily?",4,1.0,16.0,"https://youtu.be/hgG98VAmIWk

This should help. I had the same problem few days ago while trying to backup my photos and occurs the same problem. Solved it with the link’s first tutorial.. I use iCloud.com. Honestly, I just use google photos. I gave up on trying to transfer them onto my computer. I take a ton of pictures of cars, my dog, scenery, etc; and all I have to do is open google photos and hit sync then boom.

I also like google photos because it categorizes everything, so I can open the app and search for what I wanna see.. Here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201302. PhotoSync. Works like a charm. So easy.. Thank you, I saw the video, maybe it is because I tried to copy 20gb of photos all at once... Yeah but I got 20gb of photos while iCloud base storage is 5GB, 15gbs of photos are not uploaded. But does it have unlimited storage?. Tried everything from this website but the thing is my photos were not uploaded to iCloud because I have 5gb iCloud while my pictures are 20gb.
The other thing when I tried to copy paste them or import them from photos it says device is unreachable or can’t connect.. You can increase your storage to 50gb for a dollar a month. If you don't want this storage just do it till the transfers are complete and then cancel. It's as easy to cancel as it is to enroll. It's worth it as it's so easy to transfer photos this way.  Go to iCloud.com, click photos, select all, click download.. This might give your answers: https://riverinter.net/random/free-extra-cloud-storage-iphone/. Honestly, I have no clue. I just know I haven’t ran out yet and I’ve put tons of photos on there. If I ever do run out of space I’ll just create a new google account strictly for photos and use that.. Ok. Do This and retry after each Step:

- update itunes 
- disable firewall (remember to turn it back on later)
- try with other cable
- try From a different windows user

You should DFU restore to stock, then either setup as new or restore a backup from before the jailbreak was applied.

I’d be more interested in why you ‘couldn’t get the update’. Why?. If I restore will the update still be available?. Jailbreaking puts files deep into iOS file system that can’t be deleted manually.. Should be.

What model device?

What were you running before the update?

What are you running now?. So should I rejailbreak then?. I’m on iOS 12.4 and iOS 13 is available now thanks to the jailbreak but it says the iPhone will try to update later tonight.. No?? You should make a backup and reinstall iOS.. What model iPhone?. Ok I will thanks man. iPhone XR. iOS 13 is available for that model, something was blocking the update.

Is it a managed device, does it (or rather did it) have any config profiles, or was it jailbroken previously?. It was jailbroken previously but I deleted it. And just now I’m jailbreaking it again so I can I update I didn’t think it would work but it did. >it was jailbroken previously 

And there it is 🙄

How did you ‘delete’ the jailbreak?. I just deleted the app. 🤦🏻‍♂️

That doesn’t undo what’s been changed to the base OS.

So what happened is that jailbreaking deliberately break updates (since updates aren’t tested against jailbroken devices and can cause data destroying issues).

You never removed the jailbreak, so updates were still broken.

DFU restore to stock to *correctly* remove all traces of jailbreak, and  iTunes/Finder will install 13.4.1 during setup.. Pls don’t ever jailbreak because you can’t just delete unc0ver you have to delete Cydia. I did jailbreak my phone a second time but this time I enabled allow updates. So?

Turn it off.. That rust is corrosion. Unfortunately the worst think to do after a phone gets wet is plugging it into a charger or powering it on. Your best bet is to take it to a repair shop to replace the charging port and make sure there's no board damage.. If you never have repaired a iPhone I would tell you NO! Also just replacing the charging port may fix it but the motherboard still has water damage you will need to soak in in 99% isopropyl and NO RICE I mean no rice ever for a iPhone. New charging port will not fix it. yes I know, but can it be saved? Maybe hard reset?. Do u think theres a big chance of being the charging port?. I habe repaired before.

That can also cause the boot loop but if you can get it into dfu to show update and update the device does it show 4013?. >maybe hard reset

🤨. A software reset isn’t gonna undo hardware damage.

Turn it off, place it in an airtight container with desiccant and leave it for a while.  (Ideally, remove the display assembly and disconnect the battery).

Or take it to a repair shop.. It sounds like the charging port is shot for sure but there's a chance that when it was plugged into the charger it shorted something else out as well causing the boot loop. Yes that was the error that shows. What is it?. Do u think it would go into boot loop if the charging port is fucked?. Lol your NAND is fried the phone is gone. You will need a solder but I haven’t even gotten that fixed. You will need a new phone. It's possible but a tech would need to open it up to know for sure. Well my friend took to ubreakifix and they bs saying it was the screen that was damage. I thought it would also be the charging port but im uncertain. A bad screen probably wouldn't cause a boot loop but it is possible. If there's corrosion on the charging port it almost will definitely need a new one. Unfortunately water damage like that will sometimes also mean board level repairs. I would recommend cross posting to r/mobilerepair and see what they have to say. Yeah i figured. Might as well try it. Its $8 on ebay for a new charging port. there's only corrosion on the charging port tho.

So basically, I’ve noticed that the little microphone noise (I think that’s used for dictation, which I don’t have enabled.) has been going off while I’m on my phone, and sometimes when I open my camera or I’m just looking on my phone the little red line at the top off the screen that shows a screen record will pop up before going away quickly. 
My phone is oldish (iPhone SE((not the new one)) and I’ve had it for a few years, dating back to when I was with my ex-boyfriend who would log into my accounts to take screenshots of my messages, and look up really disgusting things on my browser. I’ve since changed all my passwords, and he isn’t legally allowed to have a phone (related to using my browser for disgusting things, like worst case scenario disgusting things.), but there’s more than likely a chance he’s still using one, so I’m a little bit paranoid and scared, I’d appreciate any input or opinions or advice, thanks in advance!

Tl;dr, should I be concerned about microphone noises going off and screen record banner appearing when I’m not activating either or is it just my iPhone SE being old?",3,0.72,12.0,"Short story iPhones can’t be hacked in any way you can jailbreak but never been hacked. Is there anything suspicious in Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management?. Do you have apps open in the background that may be using your microphone?. Here are a few methods to distinguish if your device has been compromised.

1. Firstly, just as a precautionary measure make sure you don’t have apps such as TeamViewer Quick Support which is often used by malicious third parties to record / share your screen with them. 

Next, the most most likely way is by installing a profile on your device 

2. Go to Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management 

(a) now if you see Profiles & Device Management it means there is a profile on your device and you can delete it from here 

(b) you don’t see the option for Profiles & Device Management which means you don’t have a profile installed on your device 

3. Now since we know there isn’t any profile let’s make sure your device isn’t jailbroken. The easiest method is to update your device to the latest version of iOS currently iOS 13.4.1 

(a) you see the update and install it successfully. Means you aren’t jailbroken.

(b) you can’t see or install the update means someone has either jailbroken your device or you need to reinstall iOS to clear up a bug / glitch.

4. Next make sure that your account hasn’t been compromised. Change your password on your iCloud Account. Do so by using a complex password and make it as long as possible (long passwords are more secure than short complex ones). Use a password manager in order to make it easier to remember them. You can find apples build in password manager in Setting > Passwords & accounts > Website & App passwords. 




These are all the methods that someone can try to comprise your device if you don’t have any rest assured your device hasn’t been compromised. I came up with these since my dad is constantly paranoid that he’s being watched and I tried to help eliminate those suspicions to no avail. But I hope this helps you at least.. I have had this exact same issue. Triple click the home button (or if you have an iPhone X or later, triple click the sleep/wake button). Then turn off the Voice Control.. My iphone 7 doesn’t have a profiles and device management.... No, I generally keep only one app open at the time. Thank you so much, this helped exponentially!! I think it’s all sorted now. The instructions were really clear so it only took me a bit to get this figured out. Thanks again!!!. It only shows if one is installed.. Check your Settings under Privacy > Microphone. I have the microphone enabled for a couple apps like snapchat and instagram, should I maybe disable those or is that ok?

My phone died yesterday.

For about two months I’ve been using for about half of the time an extension cord from which the charger would come out and disconnect easily / wouldn’t sit firmly. For about 2-3 weeks the phone started having problems with charging. I would plug the phone and it wouldn’t start charging unless I would:

\-unplug it and plug it back in, but turned 180 degrees

\-unplug it and plug it back in a lot of times

\-leave it plugged for a longer period of time

(none of the things above were a definite solution, usually 1 of the 3 would work, but I never knew which)

Yesterday I let it charge like usual in that extension cord (I think the battery was about 40%) and found it dead 20 mins later. The phone wasn’t dropped or hit or anything.

I cleaned the charging port (although there was nothing there). I long pressed the home and the lock button. I plugged it into the laptop. I let it charge for a longer period of time. I bought a new cable and did all of the above.

The screen shows nothing.

923,How to use separate iPhones for personal and work with the same Apple ID?,gagp48,2020-04-29 20:12:23,"Hello Reddit,

I’ve been an iPhone user for over 5 years, currently with my XS. I finished up my college recently and have a lot of work needs on my phone, especially calls and WhatsApp. I got the XS when it launched especially for the dual sim, so that I can use separate numbers for work and personal. However, lately, it’s not been enough differentiation and I’ve decided on getting an entirely separate phone, which is helped w a relatively inexpensive SE2 coming into the picture. 

I’m deep into the ecosystem so android wasn’t an option for me, but I’ve a major concern which I’ve not been able to solve by googling. I want to know how I can set up that phone with the same Apple ID in a way that it doesn’t sync data such as the messages or photos from my personal phone while still being able to sync data to iCloud which is natively on my work phone. I also want to know if I can use that phone w my Apple Watch since it’s the same Apple ID or not.

I’m from India, if that is relevant for the answers. Any help is highly appreciated. Thanks!",6,1.0,26.0,"Don’t.

Create a seperate AppleID for ‘work you’, then share things you need from ‘work you’ to ‘personal you’.. So you will use duel sim for work part?. This is the way to do it.... I mean, you COULD sign in with your personal Apple ID, but you would be disabling every feature and service to stop syncing their wouldn’t be a point. Plus, it it accidentally gets set to sync through an update, then you get the fun job of sorting it all out.. Okay, thank you! I’ll consider making a different ID but it’ll be rough to lose access to all the subscriptions I have on my current ID.. No, I currently have my work number on the eSim. I’ll shift that to the SE and keep the XS as my personal phone.. >fun job

Having had to help clean up after a few people who mixed things I could think of other terms for this... 😉😂. What sort of ‘subscriptions’?. Family plan the apple IDs and you can share apps, subscriptions without syncing.. Okay so their will be 2 phones then involved hmm I actually never thought of this... but wait if you don’t want your work messages going to other device why don’t you just sign out of iMessage with email. And only use your email under messages? Wouldn’t that work. Yeah, I have some experience in helping people clean that mess up. When icloud was first introduced, you’d have mothers and daughters sharing texts, sons and fathers deleting contacts and calendars. Mothers getting their sons photos... cause for years and years, everyone shared an Apple ID to share purchases. iCloud pops up and NO ONE knew how to handle it.. Mostly just Apple Music (I know I could get the family membership but I’m not paying extra for a single device), YouTube premium and iCloud storage. They’re not exactly must haves, but it’ll be an adjustment.. I considered that but I wouldn’t prefer paying extra for that. I would rather not have them, which would be okay since it’ll be my work phone only. Thanks though!. iMessage isn’t that widely used where I am, as I mentioned in the post. It’s WhatsApp mostly, and currently you can only have one number active per device on WhatsApp. So I don’t have a separate WhatsApp for work and personal, which is mostly why I want a separate device.. ... little sister getting links via handoff to what the elder brother was watching in the privacy of his bedroom 😱..

Keep your work device for work.. Oh well can’t you use the other number? Or no? Like both phones would now have a separate number then. Bahahahahahhahaha. Yep, still a thing. And then you get asked WHY does it need to be separate..... I can’t use WhatsApp on that other number until I delete my personal number’s WhatsApp or shift to another device, the latter is what I’m planning.. I can laugh about it now.... I know right?

945,Switching SIM cards with 2 iPhones?,g9r5ld,2020-04-28 17:09:18,"Hi,

I have two iPhones, both on Verizon but two different phone numbers. One was previously a company phone, but upon leaving I was allowed to keep the phone. My intent is to transfer my current personal number onto the former company phone. 

The work phone still has service on it, even after over a month. Is it possible to simply swap the SIM cards between phones and use the former company phone as my personal? Or does the service need to be fully disconnected before doing so?

I suspect that part of the issue is with a bad repair job. I had the screen replaced about a year ago. The home button has never worked right since then, it’s depressed and only works for fingerprint ID, which means I can’t hold it down along with the power button to reset.

Hey guys I'm an android guy for sure. But I might take a chance (won't sound like much of a big leap) but I'm thinking about trying out an iphone. But only a very cheap / older Iphone. Almost as a test or sampling how iphones work. Can anyone suggest what Iphone I should get? I keep hearing mostly iphone 5 or 6,6s or even possibly the 7?

My only requirements are that it must be in the $50 to $90 range (I would be buying it from amazon, or craigslist or something used for sure.) Also I want it to have solid battery life (which I love about iphones) and needs to be able to handle apps well. Thinks like facebook live, or cam streaming sites, skype type of apps. Thanks in advance.",0,0.5,17.0,"Honestly for that budget you’re not going to like the iPhone experience. 
If you want a decent phone the new SE is awesome, and if it doesn’t fit your needs, you’ll be able to sell it and not lose too much. 

Spending $90 on an 6S or lower would in my opinion be a waste of good money. The 7 is the absolute lowest spec I can recommend today, and I don’t think you’ll find one in your price range.. Ok fair enough. I'm in the situation where I don't NEED OR REALLY WANT an iphone. But I do want to kind of get use to down the road if it ""changes my life"" like people swear. Then I would like to be kind of use to iphones and see what I been missing or the ""other side"" so I was trying to take baby steps and get an iphone and just use it out if it sucks or old then move on. But I do not want to pay alot for basically a 3rd phone for myself (samsung a50, and samsung s7 that I currently have now) so kind of unique different situation that I'm trying to find.. Yeah but getting a 6S or lower will suck, the 6S will likely not be updated in September, it’s slow and it will give you a shitty the experience. 

It’s your money, but if I were you and don’t have a budget, stick with what you have until you have the money, $90 is almost 1/4 of a new SE.. Thats the thing I'm not trying to ever buy a new phone let alone an iphone ( i just dont believe in paying 1,000$ for a phone let alone even anything over 300/400 dollars at most. I currently have a samsung s7 and a samsung a50. I wanted to get the feel for an iphone and see what the hype is about. But I didn't want to spend 500+ dollars to buy something I really dont want or might not like and waste my money. That's why I was trying to get something that I can try out and not spend that much money so if I don't like it theres not too much downside. And if I do like it then maybe 1 or 2 years from now buy the iphone models thats currently out now. But saving up to buy a brand new phone is not an option since I wouldn't ever buy a brand new phone iphone or samsung regardless.. Then buy what you want, you asked for advice, I’ve given you mine.. No I understand what your saying. I'm just trying to get the most ""bang for my buck"" like I know nothing about iphones. And if I only want to spend less than $100 which would be considered the best model in that price range for those models.. I wouldn’t buy an iPhone in that price range for my worst enemy.

Depends on use case and expectation, I wouldn’t go lower than an iPhone 5S for basic tasks (as a replacement dumb phone for example), but for someone who wants a smart phone, I wouldn’t go below an 8 series.. Everyone has said either the iphone 6s or the iphone 7 for that price. So trying to get an idea if that phone is even worth it in todays age. Could this phone stillwork and be functional as a ""starter iphone"" or an introductory to apples iphones?. If you can find a decent iPhone 7 for less than $90 that’s not iCloud locked, go for it.. I have family members using the 6S and 7 series are primary phones, they are supported by the current OS, but (in my area at least), I wouldn’t find one from a reputable dealer for that price range.

Often cheap devices are third party repaired (or worse, iCloud locked to the person it was stolen from) and will not be worth the aggravation.. If you're trying the iPhone experience you won't get it with anything before a 7 or 8. Ok perfect thats what I will look for. When you said icloud locked? Can you explain what that is? and how to check that?. iCloud lock is like the google lock on an android phone. The account has to be removed from the phone before a new account be be logged in. If you click on the settings app (assuming the phone hasn’t been reset) there should be an option to sign into an iCloud account at the very top. If there is already a name/email at the top, make sure it is removed before paying for the phone. If the phone has already been reset, go through the first few setup pages and it should prompt you to login to or create an iCloud account. If it says an account is already signed in and is asking for the password, you won’t get past that screen without the password. 

Long story short. Don’t hand over any money before verifying there is no iCloud attached to the phone. It is not possible to sign out of iCloud without the user’s credentials.  If you have an iPhone that is still signed into someone else’s account they still have control of it (they can lock it remotely, they can trace its location etc).

Without the correct iCloud credentials, the only way to remove this is to DFU restore, however Apple added a check during the activation process where you have to enter the registered iCloud account credentials to complete setup.  (Known as ‘Activation Lock’)

Without the iCloud account details, it is not possible to complete activation and thus the device is useless.

Only way to check is to attempt to activate (before handing over any money).  If it asks for iCloud login, it’s activation locked.. iCloud lock is a lock that’s impossible to remove, and will make your phone useless. It’s to prevent theft.

(The reason why I her brother is typing this and not my parents is because said parents aren't as tech savvy) She is on it CONSTANTLY. For example, today she spent at least 6 hours on Roblox (shows you her age range) and refuses to get off. I know what everyone is thinking, you should talk about this with her and try to figure something out. I agree somewhat on this and our family has already for a year plus tried to get her to understand/socialize with other people in the house. The reason she was on it so much today was that everyone was occupied with work on our property and not really laying the hammer down. We have already tried the Circle app (Netgear router had it integrated until I upgraded the firmware to DD-Wrt) and the circle sucked big time. It would sometimes not sync properly, and it had a fee monthly, etc. Screen time, that's built into IOS sometimes doesn't work and doesn't have functionality with android.

I would advise to stop turning on low power mode and if possible, charge your phone at night because iOS has battery management where it charges your phone slowly then quick charges when it senses you're about to use it.

Maybe very rarely it realised that I am trying to unlock through Touch ID. I thought the thing might be broken but when I unlock the phone and go to apps where my fingerprint is needed to to use the apps, I am able to use Touch ID to verify my fingerprints. 

So now I am confused. Why does it work with all apps except for unlocking the phone? Any clue?",3,1.0,9.0,"Possibly your TouchID is disabled for unlocking your phone. Double check that setting in the TouchID section. Should be labeled as ""iPhone Unlock"". Any repairs?. Checked that already and it was set right. I changed the setting and turned it back on again. I even recorded the other thumbprint to work with Touch ID. So clearly the hardware works just fine. I wonder if there’s some bug in the iOS update itself that’s causing this inconsistent behaviour.. The battery was replaced with a third party battery about a year ago. The phone might have had water damage when I bought it two years ago.

However, how’d that matter in this context?. Interesting, possibly a restart or a backup and restore might help.. If the phone has water damage it can cause issues later on. I been fixing devices for 3 years I never seen a device just randomly do it but since you said water damage I would have to go with that. Then why does it forget to do it for every single other application or when I give the phone more fingerprints or use the scanner to approve payments etc?

It seems to be selectively doing this just for the unlock feature from the home button. That’s why I think hardware damage is the least likely explanation.. I would say backup your phone and then restore it I haven’t had that happen in a while to anyone I have fixed. Have you tried having someone scan their finger and if it fails to show it scanned it ?. Tried a new finger. Went to Touch ID settings, went through the setup of a new finger print and used another finger. So now, two fingers can use Touch ID.
